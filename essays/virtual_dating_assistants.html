    <p>Good morning,</p>

    <p><em>How It Actually Works</em> is about how the world works. </p>

    <p>Every issue comes with links to my recommended articles/podcasts/books &amp; (sometimes) an article from me.</p>

    <p>- Trevor</p>

    <h2>The Links</h2>

    <h6><a href="https://qz.com/1247382/online-dating-is-so-awful-that-people-are-paying-virtual-dating-assistants-to-impersonate-them/?utm_source=nextdraft&amp;utm_medium=email">Virtual Dating Assistants Are A Thing</a> (qz.com, article)</h6>

    <p>“I’m a woman sitting in my living room in Montréal, running proxies on my smartphone and laptop. I’m logged into my client’s Tinder and match.com accounts, appearing on these platforms (with the help of numerous fake GPS services) to be the man I’m pretending to be. I sit on my couch and wait for messages to arrive in their inbox.”</p>

    <h6><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7l2hUp0CkQ">Overwhelmed by Mutually Exclusive Advice</a> (youtube.com, 2:00 minute video)</h6>

    <p>Moving example of: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Why You should ignore most of the news</li>
      <li>Organizations responding to incentives</li>
      <li>99% of what we read online is mental sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Music also excellent.</p>

    <h6><a href="https://siderea.livejournal.com/1260265.html?format=light">Social Class and Economic Class Aren’t the Same Thing</a> (livejournal.com, article)</h6>

    <p>“The US has at least&nbsp;two different systems&nbsp;of what gets termed ‘socioeconomic class’. They are everywhere conflated, and this is bad…</p>

    <p>“It is a common confusion – or intellectual dodge – to conflate social class with economic class. But what what differentiates, say, the middle class from the working class is not mere wealth or earning power; as we all know, a plumber (presumed working class) may make much more money than a professor (presumed professional).”</p>

    <p>I read this for the 1st time about a year ago. It gave me a new lens through which to view social status, why people choose certain jobs, and how the separation of money from prestige has far-reaching consequences.</p>
