<h3>You don’t get more points for willpower</h3>

<p>Guilt often comes from thinking “I <em>should</em> know better, or I <em>could</em> choose better.” </p>

<p>As if each and every decision we make is carefully calculated in a vacuum, devoid of external influence or other factors beyond You The Decider.</p>

<p>We do stuff all the time because that’s just “what you do”. </p>

<p>Whether you do something because you actively and purposely will it, or because you were pressured, the final result is the same.</p>

<p>For example, these each lead to the same outcome:</p>

<p>You went running because…</p>

<ul>
  <li>you feel it’s a good thing to do</li>
  <li>you told your friend you would</li>
  <li>you promised you’d go <strong>with</strong> your friend</li>
  <li>you think God wants you to</li>
  <li>you joined a running group &amp; want to meet someone</li>
  <li>you were being chased by a bear</li>
</ul>

<p>The point is <strong>you went running.</strong> You aren’t a better person because you did it for the “right reason” or because “You Chose To”.</p>

<p>If you want to something figure out what makes it so you have to do the thing, so that there’s no decision, so that it’s just what you do.</p>

<p>Discover what turns an obligation from “I should do it” to “That’s just who I am”.</p>

<p>Having to relitigate every little decision in one’s life is paralyzing, so get on with it.</p>

<p>Amazing for what it gets right even while ultimately being worng.</p>

<h6><a href="https://overcast.fm/+F-0UQrwqs">Redef CEO Jason Hirschhorn on the media business</a> (podcast)</h6>

<p>The host is condescending and elitist as hell, but the guest is awesome. Goes into detail on how Netflix was laughed at when it was first purchasing content rights, a lunch with Bob Iger (CEO of Disney), his relationship with the Murdochs and insight into Fox News, and other cool inside baseball stuff.</p>

<p>Don Melton didn’t work with Steve a ton, but he has some of the best “inside Apple” articles about its renaissance on the Internet.</p>

<p>Watching this makes me deeply sad in a way that’s hard to describe. </p>

<p>Imagine missing out on one of life’s most rewarding experiences (i.e. deep relationships) because of some idiosyncratic belief you hold because of where you were born.</p>

<p>There are worse horrors to be sure, but what makes this a tragedy is how completely avoidable it is.</p>

<h6><a href="https://twitter.com/edlatimore/status/1071539277220274179">A tweet from Ed Latimore</a></h6>

<p>“The more intelligent you are, the more you consider what can go wrong. This awareness often leads to inaction. </p>

<p>“This is why sharp intellect must be married to wicked resolve and indomitable courage to be most effective.”</p>

<p>I was talking to an entrepreneur friend at dinner a few weeks ago. He said “I don’t do stupid things anymore.”</p>

<p>We both lamented how if we were starting today we’d each never had begun our respective businesses that became successful. It was only in a time of youth and naivete that we got started.</p>

<p>Sometimes experience is just another word for pessimism.</p>
