<p>Good morning,</p>

<p><em>How It Actually Works</em> is about how the world works. </p>

<p>Every issue comes with links to my recommended articles/podcasts/books &amp; (sometimes) an article from me.</p>

<p>- Trevor</p>

<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/">The Psychology of Money</a> (collaborativefund.com, article)</h6>

<p>20 flaws and biases people have with dealing money. This is not a listicle but a(nother) terrific report from Collaborative Fund.</p>

<p>Hard to excerpt but includes points like:</p>

<p>3) Rich man in the car paradox (not what you think)</p>

<p>5) Anchored-to-your-own-history bias</p>

<p>7) The seduction of pessimism in a world where optimism is the most reasonable stance.</p>

<p>11) The social utility of money coming at the direct expense of growing money</p>

<p>14) A tendency to be influenced by the actions of other people who are playing a different financial game than you are.</p>

<h6><a href="http://ncase.me/trust/">The Game of Trust</a> (ncase.me, hard to describe just check it out)</h6>

<p>It sure feels like there’s less trust in the US &amp; worldwide right now. Why? Are people just acting worse? Is there some external force?</p>

<p>This uses game theory to help explain what might be going on. (Might only work on desktop but not sure.)</p>

<h6><a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-912-drew-carey">Drew Carey on WTF Podcast</a> (wtfpod.com, audio)</h6>

<p>Like many great comedians Carey has a rough life growing up. He also served in the military (I had no idea). </p>

<p>My favorite part was hearing him explain how he did the math on how many jokes he needed to write every day so he could have a full 45-minute show by the end of the year.</p>

<h6><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html">What You Can’t Say</a> (paulgraham.com, article)</h6>

<p>“Have you ever seen an old photo of yourself and been embarrassed at the way you looked?&nbsp;Did we actually dress like that?&nbsp;We did. And we had no idea how silly we looked. It&#39;s the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all of us riding on it.</p>

<p>“What scares me is that there are moral fashions too. They&#39;re just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people. But they&#39;re much more dangerous.”</p>

<p>A classic.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80106124">Make Happy</a> (netflix.com, comedy special)</h6>

<p>To celebrate its 2-year release anniversary I’m sharing this today. I don’t want to play it up too much but this is likely my single favorite hour of media from the last few years.</p>

<p>Bo Burnham’s writing is easily as good as Lin-Manual Miranda and up there with Bob Dylan. Watch to the end.</p>

<p>I always like hearing feedback, but particularly today if anyone else is a Bo fan or watches Make Happy I’d love to hear what you think.</p>
