<h3>How to critique a startup</h3>

<p>This is an online archive of an essay from my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. If you'd like to read more material like this for free <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com">give me your email here</a>.</p>

<p>People love to make fun of “dumb” startups. </p>

<p>You might remember Juicero, the $500 juicer whose juice bags could actually be squeezed by hand for free.</p>

<p>Mocking these companies is practically a sport, where civilians &amp; tech journalists alike compete to show how smart they are for predicting the demise of a given startup.</p>

<p>But that’s fucking stupid. </p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy</strong> to make fun of startups. <strong>By design</strong> most of them go to zero.</p>

<p>Saying a startup is dumb is like predicting a pregnant woman is going to have a healthy child. </p>

<p>You can know nothing about babies and you’ll still almost always be right.</p>

<p>And so it goes with startups. If you made fun of every startup you ever saw you’d be right 95% of the time. And you’d have added nothing to the world.</p>

<p>What’s actually useful: </p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying which startups will succeed</li>
  <li>finding hidden talent</li>
  <li>helping the startups whose mission you believe in</li>
  <li>giving thoughtful feedback</li>
  <li>shutting up when you have nothing to add</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all critiques are really about making yourself look smarter.</p>

<p>So unless a company is hurting people who have no way to opt out, either lend a hand or get the fuck out of the way.</p>

<p>Singing to his audience:</p>

<p><em>“The truth is, my biggest problem&#39;s you</em></p>

<p><em>I want to please you</em></p>

<p><em>But I want to stay true to myself</em></p>

<p><em>I want to give you the night out that you deserve</em></p>

<p><em>But I want to say what I think</em></p>

<p><em>And not care what you think about it</em></p>

<p><em>Part of me loves you</em></p>

<p><em>Part of me hates you</em></p>

<p><em>Part of me needs you</em></p>

<p><em>Part of me fears you”</em></p>

<p>Stories from a man who spent 17 years in the Soviet forced-labor camps in Siberia.</p>

<p>The stories are tragic in how mundane the people are experiencing them. There’s no enlightenment, just misery and suffering.</p>
