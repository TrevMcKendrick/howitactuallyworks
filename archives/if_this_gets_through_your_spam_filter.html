<p>Good morning,</p>

<p><em>How It Actually Works</em> is about how the world works. </p>

<p>Every issue comes with links to my recommended articles/podcasts/books, and (going forward) sometimes with an article from me.</p>

<p>- Trevor</p>

<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AlexanderJarvis/leaked-salesforce-ma-strategy-for-board">Leaded Salesforce M&amp;A strategy deck</a> (slideshare)</h6>

<p>Fascinating inside look at how Salesforce analyzes potential acquisitions. Interesting notes: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Box CEO Aaron Levie noted as “CEO has no interest”</li>
  <li>Place in the Gartner Magic Quadrants really matters</li>
  <li>Uses Glassdoor CEO ratings</li>
  <li>Probably not as important in B2B, but this entire deck feels like an extreme case of “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”</li>
</ul>

<h6><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/magazine/how-gary-harts-downfall-forever-changed-american-politics.html?src=dayp">The first American political affair</a> (nyt article)</h6>

<p>How the leading Democratic candidate in the 1988 presidential campaign abruptly lost &amp; ended his career. Gary Hart is known as <strong>the</strong> guy who marks the beginning of politicians’ personal lives being fair game in the media and to voters.</p>

<h6><a href="https://medium.com/matter/sex-is-sex-but-money-is-money-e7c10091713f">Sex is Sex, But Money is Money</a> (medium article, no explicit pictures but probably NSFW)</h6>

<p>An <strong>incredible</strong> read about a Russian woman who moved to New York at 19 and worked as an escort for 5 years.</p>

<p>She considered herself an immigrant entrepreneur, and includes lessons likes “spend money to make money” and how to do pricing: </p>

<p><em>“I loved doing couples, but I charged more than twice as much. I got $2,000 an hour, and the sessions were usually at least two hours. I charged more not because the work was harder — it obviously wasn’t — but because I could. That’s the cool thing about capitalism.”</em></p>

<h6><a href="https://michaelhyatt.com/private-resources/2012-08-22-inc-mastermind.pdf">Detailed Strategy on how Michael Hyatt got his book on the NYT Bestsellers List</a> (pdf)</h6>

<p>Yes he already had an audience to work with but notice how how much work he did. And how he covered every possible angle to ensure he wouldn’t fail.</p>

<p>Success is often more calculated &amp; precise than outsiders realize.</p>
