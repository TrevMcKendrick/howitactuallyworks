<h3>Efficiency Is An Excuse To Not Do The Actual Work</h3>

<p>This is an online archive of an essay from my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. If you'd like to read more material like this for free <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com">give me your email here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to do something efficiently you’re probably stalling.</p>

<p>Pre mature optimization is the root of all evil for engineers, but it’s also an excuse that prevents progress in personal goals.2</p>

<p>Looking for efficiency in daily life is similar to seeking “the best way” of doing something.</p>

<p>And it’s insidious because the logic isn’t&nbsp;all that bad…</p>

<p><em>“If I’m going to try and lose weight, I might as well do it in the best and most efficient way possible, right?”</em></p>

<p>Wrong!</p>

<p><strong>You need momentum. You need progress. You need forward movement happening right now.</strong></p>

<p><em>The importance of morale is vastly underestimated.</em></p>

<p><strong>”I want to lose weight, what are the best exercises to do?”</strong></p>

<p>Get down RIGHT THIS SECOND and start doing push ups. Go for a run in whatever clothes you already own.</p>

<p><strong>”I want to start a SaaS business, what stack should I use?”</strong></p>

<p>Pick up the phone and call 10 potential customers to see if they want the thing.</p>

<p><strong>”There might be a parking space closer to the entrance, I’ll keep looking”</strong></p>

<p>There’s tons of parking 50 feet back, pick a spot and just walk.</p>

<p><strong>”I want to sell an online course. What’s the best way to make a website?”</strong><br/>Send 5 emails right now to the first 5 people you can think of who might need this. Do not write templates – bang out the email and hit send. If they actually need the product they won’t care about typos.</p>

<p><strong>”I want to be a photographer, I wonder what gear I should buy.”</strong></p>

<p>Use your iPhone.</p>

<p>So much &quot;work&quot; is merely distracting ourselves from the reality: we have no customers, we don&#39;t know what people want, we don&#39;t have a sales channel, and on and on.</p>

<p>If the reversal of someone’s statement sounds weird, and they don’t give any specifics, they probably aren’t saying anything that carries new information.</p>
