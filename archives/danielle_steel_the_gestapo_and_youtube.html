<h6><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/danielle-steel-books-interview">How the Hell Has Danielle Steel Managed to Write 179 Books?</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Some of this seems impossible, e.g. it says she works 20-22 hours per day. But as a friend pointed out on Twitter, in a world of 7 billion people some are bound to be genetic outliers.</p>

<p>The real takeaway – always – from these types of articles, or when someone mentions the important of hard work generally, is that 1) you should only be competing against yourself, and 2) we can all do a lot more than we individually imagine.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-nazi-critic-and-a-gestapo-spy-a-1266249.html">The Gestapo Attended a Tea Party</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“The Gestapo spy Paul Reckzeh denounced a group of Nazi critics in Berlin and two of them were executed. Irmgard Ruppel was the last survivor of the group, and in an interview five decades later, she told the story of what happened.”</p>

<h6><a href="http://milesgrimshaw.com/sequoia-investment-memo/">Sequoia’s Investment Memo in YouTube</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“It is very hard to get genuine transparency on what VCs look for when making an investment. Some investors share their investment criteria, but rarely how they have assessed opportunities against those criteria.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/">1 Genetics Research Paper Overturns 20 Years of Psychological Research</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“I love this paper because it is ruthless. The authors know exactly what they are doing, and they are clearly enjoying every second of it.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/04/19/four-kinds-of-relationship-problems/">Five Kinds of Relationships Problems</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“In my opinion, there are approximately five kinds of persistent relationship problems. I’m going to be using the word “partner”, but none of this is limited to romantic relationships.”</p>
