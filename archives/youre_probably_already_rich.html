<h3>You’re Probably Already Rich</h3>

<p>This is an online archive of an essay from my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. If you'd like to read more material like this for free <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com">give me your email here</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever I feel like I have something to lose I think about this chart, showing <strong>net worth in the US, by age</strong>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wealth_chart.png"/></figure>

<p>Two highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you&#39;re 29 and worth $10k, you have more than 50% of people your age</li>
  <li>If you&#39;re 34 and worth $250k, you have more than 90% of people your age</li>
</ul>

<p>And this is <strong>in the US!</strong> To say nothing of other countries where you’re wealthier than 99.9% of the population.</p>

<p>Some might shout “income equality!”, or try to make you feel guilty.</p>

<p>Instead look at your newly discovered wealth as an opportunity.</p>

<p>A chance to try whatever the hell you want. To take more risks because you’ve <strong>already succeeded.</strong></p>

<p>Be grateful, yes. Help others, of course.</p>

<p>But make sure you understand the opportunity you’ve been given.</p>

<p>- Trevor</p>
