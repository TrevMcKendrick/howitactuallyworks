<h3>Breaking Rules and Solving Problems</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<h6>Breaking Rules &amp; Solving Problems</h6>

<p>One of the fundamental differences between Silicon Valley and The Paper Belt (i.e. Washington DC, New York, elite universities) is what they value.</p>

<p>There are obvious narratives that you probably think I’m referring to. See:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facebook’s “move fast and break things” </li>
  <li>Uber breaking local laws to get drivers out</li>
  <li>Airbnb breaking zoning laws, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what I’m talking about today is working <em>in</em> an organization.</p>

<p>If you’re used to following rules, being rewarded for doing exactly what you’re told <em>perfectly</em>, crossing all the t’s and dotting all the i’s…. <em>you’re going to be deeply unhappy in a venture-backed startup. </em></p>

<p>You’ll encounter some company rule, adjust your workflow to it, judge your potential actions based on it, and then the rule will be suddenly changed on you w/ zero prior notice.</p>

<p>Even worse: that change <em>may not even be communicated to you</em>. It could just be culturally assumed that everyone “gets” the new way of operating, or management just was too busy to let you know.</p>

<p>And so now you’re giving 110% of your efforts to following the <em>wrong</em> rules(!)</p>

<p>Take the other side:</p>

<p>If you thrive by solving problems wherever you find them and having the flexibility to Go Forth And Conquer, operating in an organization that places extreme value on titles, org structure, and process is going to make you miserable.</p>

<p>You’ll solve problems that everyone rightly acknowledges are problems, but because you went about it in the “wrong” way you’ll actually be penalized.</p>

<p>You’ll lose your mind trying to decipher the “right” way to solve problems, instead of doing what’s easiest and fastest.</p>

<h6>Changing the Game</h6>

<p>This is one of many reasons the Paper Belt and Silicon Valley haven’t gotten along recently. Silicon Valley started winning even though it was doing all the “wrong” things. </p>

<p>And when you can do things the “wrong” way and still win, people start complaining about the game.</p>

<p>It probably says a lot about you whether your reaction is </p>

<p>“the new game is better so everyone should adjust to it” </p>

<p>vs</p>

<p>“the old game has worked fine so rule breakers should be penalized” </p>

<p>“Apart from animation and some commercials, visual comedy is actually moving backwards.”</p>

<p>Naval Ravikant on how being connected to every human on the planet opens up more possibilities than most people have considered.</p>

<p>He also adds: “When you’re competing with people it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy… <strong>Escape competition through authenticity</strong>”</p>

<p>(this clip is part of a longer talk that I haven’t watched)</p>

<p>“We have this idea of knowledge of something that’s fundamentally positive sum. If I know something it doesn’t mean you can’t know it too.” … </p>

<p>“One of the challenges of elite universities is that’s not how they think of the knowledge economy at all.” ... </p>

<p>“If you were president of Harvard or Stanford, and you had some fantasy of getting lynched by a mob of angry alumni, angry students, and angry faculty, then you should give a speech, something like the following: ‘The knowledge economy is very important, it’s something that we’re doing a great job educating people for, and obviously because it’s such a positive sum thing, we’re going to triple our enrollment over the next 20 years.’”</p>
