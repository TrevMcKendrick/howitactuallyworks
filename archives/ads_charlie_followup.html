<h3>Ads, Charlie Munger, and Following Up</h3>

<p>Good morning!</p>

<p>Welcome to July. I hope my American readers have a great 4th.</p>

<p>A terrific 101 on how companies like Charles Schwab and ETrade actually make money.</p>

<p>Famous talk given by Charlie Munger. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws">Audio here.</a></p>

<p>“With this introductory instruction from ants, magicians, and the grand general principle of social psychology; I will simply number and list psychology-based tendencies that, while generally useful, often mislead.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/">Ads Don’t Work that Way</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“Cultural imprinting is the mechanism whereby an ad, rather than trying to change our minds individually, instead changes the landscape of cultural meanings — which in turn changes how we are perceived by others when we use a product.”</p>

<p>This goes 100% against Charlie’s speech on advertising’s power from mere association (#10 on his list).</p>

<p>“Almost immediately after the app launched, both regulators and other parking businesses moved to block Haystack from operating, claiming that selling access to a public space was not permitted. Haystack’s argument—that it was not selling the parking space per se, but the information that the space was about to become open—did not prove successful. Within three weeks, the City of Boston had passed a resolution against the buying and selling of public spaces, with the intention of effectively banning Haystack.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://guzey.com/follow-up/">It is Your Responsibility to Follow Up</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“The moral here is the following: whenever you send an email to somebody (especially to somebody busy), imagine that this is what their inbox looks like. Unless you send a follow up, you’re not even trying. And they know it, so unless you follow up, they will probably just ignore you, correctly believing that you do not even want to talk to them so much.”</p>

<p>Being in our CEOs inbox has taught me this more than anything. Your highly personal, “all important email” is just another row of pixels in their inbox.</p>
