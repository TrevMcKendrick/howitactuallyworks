    <p>Good morning,</p>

    <p><em>How It Actually Works</em> is about how the world works. </p>

    <p>Every issue comes with links to my recommended articles/podcasts/books &amp; (sometimes) an article from me.</p>

    <p>- Trevor</p>

    <h2>The Links</h2>

    <h6><a href="https://everythingstudies.com/2017/11/07/the-nerd-as-the-norm/">The Nerd as the&nbsp;Norm</a> (everythingstudies.com, article)</h6>

    <p>Psychology Today wrote a “Field Guide to The Nerd”, which a self-declared nerd took a bit of offense to. </p>

    <p>So he imagined <em>what if the world was full of nerds and instead the socially active extroverted “jocks” were the exception?</em> What would the “field guide for the anti-nerd” look like?</p>

    <p>Some traits of the anti-nerd personality:</p>

    <p>• “an interest in people over things and ideas</p>

    <p>• a concern for social harmony over correctness</p>

    <p>• obliviousness to inconsistency, vagueness and ambiguity”</p>

    <h6><a href="http://fermatslibrary.com/s/how-to-subvert-democracy-montesinos-in-peru">How Much It Cost to Bribe Individuals in Power in Peru</a> (fermatslibrary.com, pdf)</h6>

    <p>A paper with detail on how much it cost 1 individual to run the entire democracy of Peru via bribery during the 90’s. </p>

    <p>For example, some judges received $2.5k - $10k USD per month, various politicians were paid up to $20k per month to change parties, TV stations were paid up to $9M / year. </p>

    <p>I only read half of this (it’s long) but it’s detailed data (the briber took videos of his negotiations and made his counter parties sign contracts) is worth dipping into.</p>

    <h6><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-startups-choose-not-to-sell-to-other-companies-and-instead-they-go-for-an-IPO">Why some entrepreneurs won’t sell their companies even if it would make them fabulously wealthy</a> (quora.com, article)</h6>

    <p>Entrepreneur who sold his company for ~$150M to Adobe explains why to some it’s not about money, but the journey, legacy, and glory of building your own thing.</p>
