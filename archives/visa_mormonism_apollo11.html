<h3>Visa, Mormonism, and Apollo 11</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Good morning!</p>

<p>Happy Monday to you. I wish you a fantastic week. </p>

<h6><a href="https://vimeo.com/349227656">Apollo 50 Launch in 4k: Washington Monument Projection Mapping</a> (video)</h6>

<p>They projected the Apollo 11 mission on to the Washington Monument for the 50th anniversary of our walking on the moon. Includes Kennedy’s moon speech. Great reminder on the importance and personal value of working on audacious projects.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A">Voice vs Exit</a> (video)</h6>

<p>Talk that Balaji Srinivasan gave at Y Combinator’s Startup School in 2013.</p>

<p>“I believe that the ability to reduce the importance of decisions made in DC in particular without lobbying or sloganeering is actually going to become extremely important over the next 10 years.”</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because today it’s Silicon Valley vs “the Paper Belt”: New York, DC, Boston, and Los Angeles. Media, research, law, finance, and culture were all set by these 4 cities, in 19th century institutions that have been fundamentally undermined by the Internet.</p>

<h6><a href="http://minesafetydisclosures.com/blog/2019/5/29/part-l-a-history-of-visa">A History of Visa</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Visa is a fantastic business with network effects that are so strong even companies like Apple are forced to partner with them vs compete.</p>

<p>How did this network come to be? </p>

<h6><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/1/18759587/mormon-church-quitmormon-exmormon-jesus-christ-internet-seo-lds">The Mormon Church vs. The Internet</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“The early years of Mormonism are well-documented and easily examined online. The Internet has also given Mormons new platforms, from forums to podcasts, where they can share their findings. The result has been a mass undoctrination.”</p>

<p>A significant part of the pain in leaving Mormonism is that <em>so much of it is good</em> – the community, the sense of identity, the feeling of belonging to something bigger than yourself – but at bottom it’s based on total nonsense. </p>

<p>The saddest part about Mormonism isn’t any specific action or ugly doctrine, but that every amazing thing it promised you is wrong.</p>
