<h3>The Perfect Decision Fallacy</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.</p>

<p>You’re ambitious and want to achieve Great Things.</p>

<p>So you work backwards and figure out all the stuff you have to do to get there. You analyze all possible paths and finally pick a direction. It kinda looks like this:</p>

<figure><img src="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/longtermplanning.jpeg"/></figure>

<p>What a depressing and bad model of the world.</p>

<p>It puts <strong>too much weight</strong> on your current decision:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can’t possibly have “all information” available</li>
  <li>The world is constantly changing, and your abilities and relationships along with it </li>
  <li>It’s kind of boring…? Like “having a computer solving a Sudoku puzzle, it’s kind of missing the point.”</li>
</ol>

<p><em>If I choose the wrong thing today I won’t achieve my dreams.</em></p>

<p>NO PRESSURE.</p>

<p>But flip it upside down and you have an adaptable strategy: take 90 days to pick a direction, go as fast as you can, then reassess:</p>

<figure><img src="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/shorttermplanning.jpeg"/></figure>

<p><strong>There are multiple paths to get to your end goal, you just don’t know what they are in advance</strong></p>

<p>John Mackey didn’t know he’d build the <a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=527979061:528000104">Whole Foods empire when he opened his first store.</a></p>

<p>Lincoln didn’t know he’d help end slavery when he decided to become a lawyer.</p>

<h6>No Precious Decisions</h6>

<p>The trick to overcoming ALL of this is decreasing the cost of any single wrong decision.</p>

<p>Candice Neistat has this great line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t treat everything like it’s a precious decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of making a few BIG decisions, make lots of LITTLE ones. </p>

<p>Instead of “would I marry this girl?” ask “would I have fun on a single date?”</p>

<p>Instead of “should I launch a new product?” ask “In 2 weeks how much can I find out about my customers’ hopes, fears, and dreams?”</p>

<p>Instead of “how do I know if a YouTube channel will grow my business?” ask “how fast can we make a single video?”</p>

<p>(And just thank God you’re not someone like Tim Cook. How the hell does he know if what he’s working on <em>today</em> is going to help Apple? He has to wait 2-3 years to get any customer feedback…)</p>

<h6>Tunnel Vision into the Unknown</h6>

<p>So the genius of <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com/essays/why_you_should_ignore_every_founders_story_about_how_they_started_their_company.html">people like Sam Walton or Reed Hastings isn’t some eureka moment of discovery</a>, it’s <strong>the mental toughness and determination to take small steps forward, not knowing where they’d ultimately end up.</strong></p>

<p>A friend of mine went from teaching high school 3 years ago to working for Apple in Cupertino today. </p>

<p>Someone asked him what his next long-term goals and plans were. Good question for someone who’d advanced so fast, right?</p>

<p>You know where this is going: his answer was </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“3 years ago I had no idea I’d be where I’m at today, why would I try to predict where I’ll be in another 3 years?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s tunnel-vision down on being awesome at what’s in front of him, even while he’s uncertain of the future.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-things-to-hang-on-your-mental-mug-tree">Advertising Legend Rory Sutherland on Mental Models</a></h6>

<p>Covers ideas like 1) Why an ad for a product in Eastern Europe under Communism would <em>decrease</em> sales, 2) Why we pay 100,000x more for a Picasso painting, but not for the house that he lived in, 3) Why good communication always requires some inefficiency.</p>

<p>Details the backstory of various famous leaders, e.g. Napoleon and Julias Caesar. I highly recommend <a href="https://httotw.com/podcast/2018/1/11/ep4-vladimir-putin-12">the 2 episodes about Putin</a> explaining how quickly he rose to power: amazingly Putin was still a bureaucrat nobody knew into his 40s. </p>

<h6><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Arlene/WME_4_embed.jpg">Ari Emanuel at 33 (image)</a></h6>

<p>Career Goal: “Besides getting money and power, I haven’t figured it out yet.”</p>

<p>Business philosophy: “<em>Fair</em> is defined as where we end up.”</p>

<p><strong>Attorney: </strong>“And you ordered the murder of a customs agent, is that correct?”</p>

<p><strong>Witness: </strong>“That is not correct.”</p>

<p><strong>Attorney: </strong>“What part of that was not correct?”</p>

<p><strong>Witness: </strong>“She was not a customs agent.”</p>

<p>😲</p>

<p>Remarkable 7-part series on the most amazing criminal you’ve never heard of. Save this for your weekend reading.</p>
