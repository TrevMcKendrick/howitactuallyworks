<h3>Why You Should Ignore Every Founder's Story About How They Started Their Company</h3>

<h6>Founding Stories Are Myths</h6>

<p>Company founding stories are almost always non-malicious lies. Take Netflix:</p>

<figure><img src="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/netflix.png"/></figure>

<p>Reed Hastings has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/02/07-reed-hastings">said</a> <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/2009/01/27/news/newsmakers/hastings_netflix.fortune/index.html">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/2746816142?lang=en">times</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/12/netflix-6/">that</a> <a href="http://www.evancarmichael.com/library/reed-hastings/Reed-Hastings-Quotes.html">he got the</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/reed-hastings-innovator-year-81514">idea</a> for Netflix because he once was charged a $40 late fee on Apollo 13.</p>

<p>That didn't actually happen. </p>

<p>It's unfortunate because it will inevitably mislead anyone learning how to start a company. </p>

<h6>Sam Walton's Overnight Success</h6>
<br>
<figure><img src="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/grand_opening.png"/></figure>

<p>Sam was already 44(!) when he opened the first Walmart and had been running his own retail stores for over 15 years.</p>

<p>He wondered why people focused on the beginning of Walmart: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Somehow over the years folks have gotten the impression that Walmart was something I dreamed up out of the blue as a middle-aged man, and that it was just this great idea that turned into an overnight success... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Like most overnight successes, it was about 20 years in the making.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're trying to build your own thing & you want to learn from "the founder of Walmart", looking at the start of the company itself is stupid because at that point he already had 15 years of experience</p>

<p>So let's start with Sam's very first store.</p>

<h6>The Biggest Mistake Of Sam's Professional Life</h6>

<p>Sam started his retail career at 27 buying his 1st store, a "Ben Franklin" variety store franchise. </p>

<p>As a beginner he relied on the franchise's playbook but also incorporated his own experiments. </p>

<p>Things like:</p>

<ul><strong>
  <li>putting popcorn & ice cream machines in front of the store to drive traffic</li>
  <li>doing huge discounts but actually making it up in volume (i.e. not ironically)</li>
  <li>buying directly from manufactures instead of going through the franchise (which allowed for cheaper prices)</li>
</ul></strong>

<p>He worked hard on that single store for 5 years, grew sales 3.5x to $250k/year and became the #1 Ben Franklin franchisee in his six-state region.</p>

<p>But then he found out he'd made a gigantic mistake.</p>

<p><strong><em>When he signed the store lease he didn't include an option to renew it.</em></strong></p>

<p>The owner (a local department store competitor) saw his success & refused to renew the lease at any price, thereby forcing Sam to shut down the store.</p>

<p>Imagine working on something for 5 years straight, becoming the best at it, and then having a single person end it all.</p>

<p>Sam was devastated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>It was the lowpoint of my business life. I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't believe it was happening to me... I had built the best variety store in the whole region and worked hard in the community - done everything right - and now I was being kicked out of town. It didn't seem fair. I blamed myself for ever getting suckered into such an awful lease, and I was furious at the landlord.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was mad, but he accepted responsibility:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>I've always thought of problems as challenges, and this one wasn't any different... I had to pick myself up and get on with it, do it all over again, only even better this time.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Facebook or Google change their algorithms you at least get to keep your old customer base and your business assets.</p>

<p>But with a retail store you have none of that. </p>

<p>And because of the structure of the town they couldn't just open another store somewhere nearby.</p>

<p>The Waltons literally had to pack up their family of 6 and go find a new town.</p>

<figure><img src="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/shadow_figures.jpg"/></figure>

<p>If he'd wanted to Sam had plenty of reasons to sulk: they were starting all over in a <em>smaller</em> town (Bentonville) that also had its fair share of competition (3 other variety stores). </p>

<p><strong>But Sam said "it didn't matter much because I had big plans."</strong></p>

<h6>Unsexy Determination</h6>

<p>Sam spent the next 12 years in what I call <em>narrative limbo</em>.</p>

<p>It's the crucial part of any "overnight success" that doesn't get covered in the Successful Entrepreneur genre.</p>

<p>No one writes about all the random tangents and mistakes you make here.</p>

<p>Like, say, that time Sam tried to start a shopping mall 10 years too early and lost $25,000? </p>

<p>Or what about the time a tornado destroyed his best performing store? All he had to say was "we just rebuilt it and got back at it."</p>

<p>This is important to know if you're trying to learn from Sam, but it doesn't fit into any narrative.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that there will be mistakes and problems on any path to success. As a recent book title says, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3L1B8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">those obstacles are the way itself.</a></p>

<p>A coworker said Sam excelled here because he woke up every day "determined to improve something", and that he was</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>less afraid of being wrong than anyone I've ever known...Once he sees he's wrong, he just shakes it off and heads in another direction.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don't get any of this from Reed Hastings when he talks about $40 late fees. You think "oh I need a great idea" when the reality is the idea is nothing and your psychology & persistence is everything.</p>

<p>Eventually Sam got to 15 stores & by 1960 was the largest independent variety store operator in the US, doing a a total of ~$12M (in 2018 dollars) in annual revenue.</p>

<h6>It Would Seem Obvious</h6>

<p>It was here that Sam finally saw the opportunity for much bigger discount stores and got to work on the 1st Walmart.</p>

<p>He was the most successful independent operator in the US & had 15 years of experience in retail, surely it should have been easy for him to raise money from investors...?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Sam asked other store owners, entrepreneurs, competitors... basically everyone said no.</p>

<p>He got a measly 5% from his own brother & a store manager and had to borrow the other 95% (signing their house and all their other stores as collateral).</p>

<p><strong><em>Even the great Sam Walton couldn't find investors to start the 1st Walmart, on the back of a near-perfect record in retail.</em></strong></p>

<h6>The 1st Wal-Mart</h6>

<p>Finally, the point where most people look at to learn, is the end of our story.</p>

<p>The 1st Walmart was an ugly retail store (8-foot ceilings, concrete floor, wooden fixtures) but it worked because Walmart's prices always beat competitors. </p>

<p>(Even the name "Walmart" was selected with customer prices in mind: it was cheaper to buy neon signs for 7 letters than the longer names Sam considered.)</p>

<p>And you think Sam cared 2 cents about what anyone else thought about his stores? </p>

<p>The New York Times doesn't mention Sam or Walmart until 1969, 7 years after the 1st store opening, and he's just one random quote in the back of the paper:</p>

<figure><img src="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/south.png"/></figure>

<p>And the Walmart 1970 IPO got a <em>single</em> mention on page 44 of the Times:</p>

<p>If you want to learn from entrepreneurs, look at the start not the finish.</p>
