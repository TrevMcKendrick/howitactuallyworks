<h3>How to Feel Like a Badass</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>What a week/year/lifetime it’s been. Nothing is happening but everything is happening.</p>

<p>As I write this I recognize how cliche that is. Are new words and phrases about Corona even possible right now? It would be hard to write something unique.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think the most unique think you can do – and this is timeless, unsexy advice – is to focus on what you can control. </p>

<p>This has the obvious benefit of putting your attention on things you can actually influence, instead of flailing in frustration.</p>

<p>But it also has the psychological affect of giving you personal satisfaction and comfort. If you know you’re doing all you can, you naturally feel better about yourself and your life, <em>no matter what the outcomes end up being.</em> </p>

<p>There is no better feeling than walking the streets knowing you’re a badass because you’re putting in the right work.</p>

<p>Have a great week.</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<h6><a href="https://gfile.thedispatch.com/p/a-weiji-is-a-terrible-thing-to-waste">Earned Success</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“People need to feel needed. They need what Arthur calls the feeling of earned success. You can get that feeling from making money, but you can also get it from being a little league coach, a stay-at-home mom or dad, or a parish priest. The point is that people want to feel needed, that if they disappeared tomorrow they’d be missed.”</p>

<p>Such a great article on how there are some things – like self worth or a sense of purpose – that no one except you can earn.</p>

<p>Who knows how much of this will end up being true, but boy a lot of it feels narratively correct. Worth a 30 second read.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jojo-Rabbit-Roman-Griffin-Davis/dp/B0813KM1F9">Jo Jo Rabbit</a> (movie)</h6>

<p>Had never heard of it until my family told me we were watching it together. (Apparently was nominated for best picture last year?)</p>

<p>Here’s one summary I found that I like:</p>

<p><em>Jojo is a lonely German boy who discovers that his single mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their attic. Aided only by his imaginary friend -- Adolf Hitler -- Jojo must confront his blind nationalism as World War II continues to rage on.</em></p>

<p>New favorite movie for me. Feels like a Wes Anderson flick but with actual meaning. </p>

<p>Made me feel alive again.</p>
