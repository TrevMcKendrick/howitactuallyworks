<h6><a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com/memos">A list of interesting memos I’ve collected</a></h6>

<p>Includes negotiations from Steve Jobs, how to communicate internally from Elon Musk, strategies for Jimmy Carter in creating the Camp David Accords, and others.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.kennorton.com/essays/the-time-i-flew-on-the-enron-jet.html">That Time I Flew on the Enron Jet</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Guy who partnered his company with Enron about the due diligence process, including meeting Jeff Skilling.</p>

<h6><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/02/amazon-and-taxes.html">Amazon and taxes: a simple primer</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“The main reason Amazon as a corporate entity does not pay much in taxes is because the company so vigorously reinvests its profit.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://marshallhaas.com/making-physical-product-7-figure/">How I Lost $100k, Pissed Off 500 People, &amp; Turned It Around To Build a 7-Figure Business</a> (article)</h6>

<p>I saw this from the outside and while it was obvious they’d had problems, I had no idea how bad it was. </p>

<p>One of the most fascinating parts of life to me is the difference between the external public perception of an organization and the internal reality.</p>

<h6><a href="http://trevors-personal-files.s3.amazonaws.com/PDFs/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Methods%20of%20Rationality.pdf">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a> (PDF book)</h6>

<p>A classic that I’ve tried reading twice, gotten 30 or so chapters into. </p>

<p>Many people love this book, figured if you hadn’t heard of it you should at least take a look.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGxrnJ3NLgAhUEbq0KHX32CtgQFjAAegQIChAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup%2Fdp%2F152473165X&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gTJD5HyXtHYrc4_YXtfQW">Bad Blood</a> (book)</h6>

<p>The popular book about the infamous blood testing company, Theranos, and its charismatic founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes. </p>

<p>I have a confession: when the reports first came out about Theranos I didn’t believe them. Journalists are constantly tearing down entrepreneurs and so I assumed this was more of the same. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Documentary about all the random places Bill Murray shows up to hang with non-celebrities. Surprisingly moving.</p>
