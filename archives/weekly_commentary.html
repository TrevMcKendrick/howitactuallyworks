<p>Good morning,</p>

<p><em>How It Actually Works</em> is about how the world works. </p>

<p>Every issue comes with links to my recommended articles/podcasts/books &amp; (sometimes) an article from me.</p>

<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/The-Forging-of-a-Skeptic_Buffett.pdf">Interview with Warren Buffett’s Biographer</a> (csinvesting.org, pdf)</h6>

<p>Great bits about Buffett but my favorite parts were about becoming a biographer. Alice Schroeder had a background in audit, finance, and Wall St. Talking about her fear she had: </p>

<p>“Every word that you put on paper is an expression of your window on the world, of your abilities. It’s going to be judged and often judged harshly. In this case, it was a book that would be potentially historic. I was worried from the first day to the last as to whether I could live up to the responsibility I had been given. I was afraid of all kinds of other things. I was afraid of failure. I had to learn to write narrative and I was afraid of failing at that. I had to learn to interview like a journalist, which is a very difficult skill.”</p>

<p>I read her <a href="https://amzn.to/2Jf1tSp">book on Buffett last year</a>, called Snowball. It’s fantastic.</p>

<h6><a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorPearsonMe/status/981606428338143234">How to Stop Procrastinating</a> (twitter.com, tweetstorm)</h6>

<p>“The Drama Denominator is a simple, yet powerful [idea]: you are the common denominator of all the drama in your life. You haven’t had 5 crappy jobs or 3 crappy relationships in a row. They did not happen to you. You happened to them.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80189653">Ricky Gervais’ Latest Comedy Special</a> (netflix.com, video)</h6>

<p>Brilliant.</p>
