<h3>In Defense of Thinking Bigger</h3>

<p>It’s recently become cool to talk about the math behind venture-backed technology startups,and how so few of them achieve their implicit financial goals.</p>

<p>You might have seen funds like Indie.VC, Earnest Capital, Tinyseed… investment funds for <em>bootstrappers</em>. These fill a need in the market for sure. Whether they can be successful is another question, but small companies that don’t want to a billion dollars currently have limited capital sources.</p>

<p>I’ve done the “how many customers do I need a month to make $1m in revenue” more times than I can count. I have multiple spreadsheets showing the different types of products and pricing plans that would get me to that goal.</p>

<p>It was kind of silly.</p>

<p>The problem is that it made my thinking so small. Instead of thinking about how to grow and create value, I thought about how to convince a few specific people to buy a very specific product.</p>

<p>I was shooting for a net worth of e.g. $5 million, so that’s as high as I was ever thinking!</p>

<p>Now I’m around people who are thinking way bigger. It’s changed how I think about what I want to do, and what I could accomplish.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that everyone should do a big venture-backed startup, or raise a ton of money, or even be an entrepreneur. </p>

<p>It’s just probably true that we each underestimate our potential. We can’t all be Elon Musk, but we can all easily do 3x more, perhaps 10x more, than we each believe.</p>

<p>“Effort is a big deal. And effort is sort an arrival of sorts for society. The ‘look how hard I work, look at how much effort I’m putting in, and therefore I am doing the right thing by doing that.’</p>

<p>“And the problem that arises from that often times is those that are very efficient are demonized.”</p>
