<h3>Great Business Writing</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Hello and good morning! Don’t forget my new slogan: Optimism 2020! </p>

<p>So far it seems to be working.</p>

<p>&quot;I think you&#39;re probably right. Tell me more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I appreciate you pointing that out. I didn&#39;t see it before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where do we go from here? What&#39;s the next step?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can I help?&quot;</p>

<p>“I view “belief in excellence” as one of the underlying philosophies of MR, and also belief in the notion that excellence should be mentioned and promoted.”</p>

<p>Please, please can everyone read this?</p>

<p>“1. Writing a business memo, email, or short analysis is not like other writing. It is not meant to entertain, it is meant to convey your point of view.”</p>

<p>“2. Get to the point quickly.”</p>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>This is what I try to do in this newsletter. No fluff. Delete every possible extra word. </p>

<p>Peter Thiel reviews Ross Douthat’s new book “The Decadent Society”:</p>

<p>“For technologists, that means pursuing goals that are difficult but possible: cures for cancer and ­Alzheimer’s; compact nuclear reactors and fusion power. For statesmen, that means deconstructing the ­corrupt institutions that have falsely claimed to pursue those goals on our behalf.</p>

<p>“It is a paradox of our time that the path to radical progress begins with moderation. Extreme optimism and fatalistic pessimism may seem to be stark opposites, but they both end in apathy. If things were sure to improve or bound to collapse, then our actions would not matter one way or the other.”</p>

<p>Leaving San Francisco to visit Seoul and Tokyo leaves me embarrassed and disappointed to come back. Those are actual cities. Vibrant and large and options and, amazingly, public transportation everywhere. San Francisco is… something else. </p>

<p>The most disappointing thing about American cities is the lost potential. Can you imagine what we could build if we were given the same freedom as we currently have on the Internet? If opting in/out of different types of housing was as easy as opening a new browser tab? If things don’t exist in America it’s never because of a lack of ambition, imagination, or moxy.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that we’re not building the right things. The problem is that we aren’t allowing 10,000 different options to appear by whoever the hell wants to make them.</p>
