<h3>Lived  Experience</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I’m in Seoul this week, visiting my brother and hanging with friends.</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<h6>Who Are You</h6>

<p>There’s something really nice about being in another country and realizing how arbitrary your culture is.</p>

<p>For example, I’ve seen many people in the US with <em>very</em> strong opinions about whether it’s socially acceptable to take off your shoes while flying. From what I’ve gathered, the “correct” American answer is “hell no that’s disgusting.”</p>

<p>So you’ll imagine my delight when getting on a Korean Air flight and seeing 1) slippers on every seat in the plane, and 2) seeing almost every Korean person on the flight immediately take off their shoes to put on the slippers.</p>

<p>(My bias here is to feel vindicated, because long flights with shoes on is a PITA.)</p>

<p>Now, this is a single, silly, small observation from one flight.</p>

<p>But imagine how much your perspective would be influenced if you lived in another country, learned and used the local language, ate and drank their food, and celebrated their holidays. </p>

<p>You’d come away with powerful learnings both about the new culture but also about your own. You’d learn more about what’s actually “true” and what your culture just happened to choose a long time before you were born. You’d probably feel even more strongly about certain parts of your country, and less certain on others.</p>

<p>This is just one example of the power of lived experience. Of what actually makes you who you are.</p>

<p>“I am not particularly excited to write this article. My instinct is towards free trade, my affinity for Asia generally and Greater China specifically, my welfare enhanced by staying off China’s radar. And yet, for all that the idea of being a global citizen is an alluring concept and largely my lived experience, I find in situations like this that I am undoubtedly a child of the West. I do believe in the individual, in free speech, and in democracy, no matter how poorly practiced in the United States or elsewhere. And, in situations like this weekend, when values meet money, I worry just how many companies are capable of choosing the former?” </p>

<p>Our earlier responses to China now feels pretty damn naive. </p>

<p>Making decisions for a group is really hard, because if you go against the group and are wrong you’ll be remember forever, but if you go against the group and are right no one will remember at all.</p>

<p>“Federal judges have left no ambiguity about whether the conduct of the campus sex crimes bureaucracy is ‘consistent with the most basic principles we teach.’ In nearly 200 cases, students suing their universities for violating their due process rights in campus proceedings have obtained favorable rulings or settled out of court, vindicating what Gersen and her colleagues have maintained from the outset would be an inevitable outcome. And yet when Gersen and her colleagues roused 28 of their peers in opposition to a policy that the courts were sure to repudiate back in 2014, they stood alone in all of American academia.”</p>
