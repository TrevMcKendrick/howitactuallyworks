<h3>Links for January 28, 2019</h3>

<p>This is an online archive of an essay from my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. If you'd like to read more material like this for free <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com">give me your email here</a>.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/arts/music/tour-laundry-hans-juergen-topf.html">He Knows the Stars’ Dirty Laundry because he Washes It</a> (article)</h6>

<p>It turns out the guy who’s been washing celebrities’ laundry for 40 years knows a lot about them.</p>

<h6><a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido">Venezuela’s (Possibly) New President</a> (twitter account)</h6>

<p>Watching Juan Guaidó claim to be the new President of Venezuela has been fascinating. Dozens of countries recognized him as the new legitimate president, including posting on Twitter. </p>

<p>It’s been fascinating to watch Juan thank the countries’ leaders and state departments on Twitter. See <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1088218475603087361">Argentina</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1088219725648273408">Colombia</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1088220227375108096">Peru</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1088221636267003909">Chile</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1088222993808019456">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1088223916181590017">Paraguay</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1088214645792559104">United States of America</a>.</p>

<p>For the most part it feels like posting on Twitter is what makes the announcement official.</p>

<h6><a href="https://research.swtch.com/deps">Our Software Dependency Problem</a> (article)</h6>

<p>On the potential problems stemming from depending on strangers’ code.</p>

<h6><a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-to-become-insanely-well-connected/">How to become Well Connected</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Actionable advice on how to grow a network.</p>

<h6><a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful">How to Be Successful</a> (article)</h6>

<p>It’s worth recommending twice. Just read it.</p>

<p>My favorite point is probably #2: “Have almost too much self-belief”</p>
