<h3>The world is made by people no smarter than you</h3>

<p>Good morning and hello!</p>

<p>I hope you have a great week.</p>

<p>If you’re a non-technical person here’s your guide to being a great cofounder.</p>

<p>“Every successful startup I know has at least one person who provides the force of will to make the startup happen…He was fully in, with an average email response time of about 5 minutes to anything. Elon and I were both busy with day jobs, but Greg kept everything moving forward with imperfect information and a very high-latency connection.”</p>

<p>I needed this article this weekend. Reminded me that </p>

<ul>
  <li>authoritarian anything is mostly bullshit</li>
  <li>question everything</li>
  <li>we can all add a lot more to the world</li>
</ul>

<p>This bit in particular is spot on:</p>

<p>“I take it as an axiom that we&#39;re only achieving 1% of what we could. This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our heads as children: that things are the way they are because that is how things have to be.”</p>

<p>Which leads me to…</p>

<h6><a href="https://youtu.be/oKkwbM3zM8M?t=6">The world is made by people no smarter than you.</a> (youtube)</h6>

<p>Classic 60 seconds from a 1994 Steve Jobs interview. You should watch the video but if you just can’t click through here’s the whole quote…</p>

<p>“When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That&#39;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.”</p>

<p>“Bodhidharma asks: ‘Well, what do you think of gay people?’</p>

<p>The Emperor answers: ‘What do you think I am, some kind of homophobic bigot? Of course I have nothing against gay people!’</p>

<p>And Bodhidharma answers: ‘Thus do you gain no merit by tolerating them!’”</p>
