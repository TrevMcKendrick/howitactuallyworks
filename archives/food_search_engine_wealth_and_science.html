<p>I’m in DC today &amp; tomorrow, then back in SF for the rest of the week. Hoping to do one final round of goodbyes in Austin next week.</p>

<h6><a href="https://vimeo.com/85490944">Spotify Engineering Culture</a> (video)</h6>

<p>At Lambda School we’ve been preparing the organization for a lot of growth. Spotify’s video is a good example of something we’re about to implement. <a href="https://vimeo.com/94950270">Watch Part 2 here.</a></p>

<h6><a href="https://startupboy.com/2019/02/28/seek-wealth/">Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status</a> (transcript + video)</h6>

<p>Naval Ravikant: “The problem is that by playing these status games, to win at a status game you have to put somebody else down. That’s why you should avoid status games in your life because they make you into an angry combative person. You’re always fighting to put other people down, to put yourself and the people which you like up. And they’re always gonna exist.</p>

<h6><a href="https://nutrita.app/">The Keto and Low-Carb Food Search Engine</a> (product)</h6>

<p>Interesting product for identifying foods that fit a specific diet.</p>

<h6><a href="https://elaineou.com/2019/02/25/spin/">Spin</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Interesting follow up <em>Bad Blood</em>: “Last week there was yet another Theranos piece in Vanity Fair, and it amounts to little more than silly gossip. Apparently Elizabeth Holmes got a Siberian Husky named Balto.”</p>

<h6><a href="http://blog.jasoncrawford.org/two-pizza-teams">Amazon’s 2 Pizza Teams</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“Once approved, the team is then free to execute relatively autonomously to maximize its fitness function—to pursue creative strategies and to set its own internal priorities.”</p>

<p>Not sure if they do this anymore, but Amazon’s small teams allowed them to move <em>fast</em>.</p>

<h6><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/">Rule Thinkers In, Not Out</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“Imagine a black box which, when you pressed a button, would generate a scientific hypothesis. 50% of its hypotheses are false; 50% are true hypotheses as game-changing and elegant as relativity. Even despite the error rate, it’s easy to see this box would quickly surpass space capsules, da Vinci paintings, and printer ink cartridges to become the most valuable object in the world.” … </p>

<p>“What if the box had only a 10% success rate? A 1% success rate? My guess is: still most valuable object in the world….You have to go pretty low before the box stops being great.”</p>
