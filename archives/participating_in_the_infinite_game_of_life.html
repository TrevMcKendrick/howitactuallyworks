<h3>Participating in the Infinite Game of Life</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Happy Monday everyone. I hope you have a great day!</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<h3>Everything is broken</h3>

<p>A big part of the frustration of life is that everything seems totally fucking broken. Your employer is bureaucratic, there’s too much traffic, you have to wait 90 minutes on hold for customer support, etc. </p>

<p>We could each make a list of ways the world doesn’t live up to our expectations. And boy would that be maddening. </p>

<p>I personally feel much better, happier, and motivated when I remind myself that all of this brokenness was built by individual people.</p>

<p>When I remember that everything is made by a bunch of random humans, my expectations of how it should work lower <em>dramatically</em>.</p>

<p>It’s not like there was some single, all-powerful designer who purposefully made everything as it is.</p>

<p>No, everything’s been touched, and poked, and stacked upon like sedentary rock over many years. What we see today is the almost random output of all that’s come before.</p>

<p>Everything we see and experience is just part of the brokenness of life. We’re all in this big sandbox playing the game together.</p>

<h3>And You Can Fix It</h3>

<p>But that doesn’t mean we should just lower our expectations and prepare for mediocrity every day until we die.</p>

<p>Instead let’s focus on the humanity behind every problem and every missed expectation.</p>

<p>By remembering that there’s people behind every problem, you remind yourself that solving those problems is within your reach. And that you can influence things.</p>

<p>And then instead of screaming in frustration from the sidelines, life becomes a dance you get to participate in.</p>

<p>Yes the big stuff will still frustrate you. Yes a lot of things will stay broken in our lifetimes.</p>

<p>But how much better is life when you empower yourself and contribute to the game.</p>

<p>And everyone can do this, whether in big or small ways. Such comes many of the joys of life.</p>

<p>What you don’t want is to complain to some higher power outside the bounds of your control. “This isn’t the way it should be, somebody fix it!!” they scream into the text field, or to their Senators. Relegating the solution to “out there” robs yourself of the chance to make a contribution.</p>

<p>It gives you the moral satisfaction of complaining without the responsibility of being part of a solution.</p>

<p>May we all find satisfaction and personal joy by participating in the infinite game of life.</p>

<p>“Before Dylan discovered Woody he was playing electric guitar and piano and trying to create a band to become a rock and roll star. It was hearing Woody for the first time and reading his autobiography Bound for Glory that literally changed his life and made him pick up an acoustic guitar.”</p>

<p>“The humans use Arecibo to look for extraterrestrial intelligence. Their desire to make a connection is so strong that they’ve created an ear capable of hearing across the universe.</p>

<p>But I and my fellow parrots are right here. Why aren’t they interested in listening to our voices?</p>

<p>We’re a nonhuman species capable of communicating with them. Aren’t we exactly what humans are looking for?”</p>

<p>In case the significance isn’t clear: <a href="https://twitter.com/Meaningness/status/1162428442664554496">“This is the first time anyone is paying to get CO2 removed from the atmosphere commercially.”</a></p>

<p>The most cynical interpretation: expensive virtual signaling to attract typically liberal tech talent. </p>

<p>Or the most generous interpretation: an altruistic company offering to go first in the creation of a market for the commercial sequestration of carbon</p>

<p>And of course the combination of the two that is the genius of modernity: doing something in your own self interest that also happens to benefits everyone else.</p>

<p>Bill Gurley post from a few years ago about trends Benchmark is betting on in the “consumerization” of healthcare.</p>

<p>Having experienced the power of incentive alignment here @ Lambda, seeing increased adoption of things like high deductibles and coinsurance give me some hope for our American healthcare costs. </p>

<p>I get the sense that healthcare is now finally getting ripe to have parts of the pie picked off by new entrants.</p>
