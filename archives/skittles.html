<h3>Skittles, Politics, and Harry Potter</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>I’m hoping to write more soon. For now there’s the usual links below.</p>

<p>“This is a follow-up to a post from earlier this year discussing the likelihood of encountering two identical packs of Skittles, that is, two packs having exactly the same number of candies of each flavor. Under some reasonable assumptions, it was estimated that we should expect to have to inspect “only about 400-500 packs” on average until encountering a first duplicate.”</p>

<p>“My hypothesis is that rightism is what happens when you’re optimizing for surviving an unsafe environment, leftism is what happens when you’re optimized for thriving in a safe environment.”</p>
