<p>Good morning,</p>

<p><em>How It Actually Works</em> is about how the world works. </p>

<p>Every issue comes with links to my recommended articles/podcasts/books, and (going forward) sometimes with an article from me.</p>

<p>- Trevor</p>

<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/americas-best-selling-cars-and-trucks-are-built-on-lies-the-rise-of-fake-engine-noise/2015/01/21/6db09a10-a0ba-11e4-b146-577832eafcb4_story.html?utm_term=.a0e11dca6e7e">Carmakers have been digitally faking engine noise to appeal to masculine buyers </a></h6>

<p>“Softer-sounding engines are actually a positive symbol of just how far engines and gas economy have progressed. </p>

<p>“But automakers say they resort to artifice because they understand a key car-buyer paradox: Drivers want all the force and fuel savings of a newer, better engine — but the classic sound of an old gas-guzzler.”</p>

<h6><a href="http://communitymade.com/episodes/an-event-networking-guide/">How to network at events, from Jayson Gaignard</a></h6>

<p>I include material like this because it’s honest about how to operate in the world: relationships matter, some people are worth talking to (and others aren’t), and being strategic in how you prioritize relationships is OK.</p>

<p>This was a super actionable 60 minutes (I wouldn’t share it if it weren’t), including specific phrases to use before, during, and after events, how to plan your event-attending strategy, how to stay in touch after events, etc.</p>

<h6><a href="https://amzn.to/2IFTLMH">John Adams, by David McCullough</a> (book)</h6>

<p>Halfway finished but can already recommend. </p>

<p>Didn’t realize Adams had such an important role in the Declaration of Independence, or that he wrote the Constitution for Massachusetts (currently the oldest active constitution in the world).</p>

<p>A favorite part of biographies is seeing the mental weaknesses &amp; worries of people who eventually get statues and buildings with their names. This one doesn’t disappoint.</p>

<h6><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/04/lessons-from-the-profit.html">Why reality TV might be a good way to teach entrepreneurship</a></h6>

<p>Small company outputs differ as much as 2x given the same inputs (!), and a lot of that difference comes from better management practices that are best taught live/in person, not in a book. <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2018/03/toward-reality-tv-mbas.html">More here.</a></p>
