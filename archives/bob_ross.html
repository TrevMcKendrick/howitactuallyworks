<h3>Bob Ross, Daily Practice, and the Refragmentation</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>Great quote from Ross Perot who died last week:</p>

<p>”Life is never more fun than when you&#39;re the underdog competing against the giants.&quot;</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<p>Tyler Cowen’s “partial list of some of [his] intellectual practice strategies.”</p>

<p>What would the list be for startup founder CEOs? </p>

<p>“The system is not fixable because it is not broken. It is working, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to give the insiders their royal prerogatives, and to shove the regulations, the laws, and the debt up the asses of everyone else.” </p>

<p>Doesn’t capture my view exactly but much of the rage is spot on.</p>

<p>Paul Graham 3 years ago on why everyone in America isn’t like everyone else anymore. </p>

<p>Fast forward 100 years, and the individuality enabled by the Internet is going to be literally extraordinary, for better or worse. I want to see the outfits.</p>
