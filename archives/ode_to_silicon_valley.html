<h3>Ode to Silicon Valley</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Good morning!</p>

<p>My favorite blog posts or books tend to be ones that clue me in on some “secret”. I.e. some new frame of reference on how to view some part of the world or human experience.</p>

<p>If you have a favorite book or blog post please send it over.</p>

<h6>The Caravan Goes On</h6>

<p>Everywhere I look around Silicon Valley I see earnest people trying to build things.</p>

<p>Individuals, teams, companies… all working towards the effort of solving some actual problem for other humans. Not by decree or violence, by but actually making new things.</p>

<p>Where else do you get so many people excited about building <a href="lambdaschool.com">new schools</a>? Or <a href="https://truepill.com">Pharmacy APIs</a>? Or cheaper and better ways to get <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/technology/">primary medical care</a>?</p>

<p>This is a place that wants nothing more than a random, no-name person to walk into your office and tell you a story about how they’re honest-to-god going to change the world. </p>

<p>Silicon Valley is a place where the world is changed so often that you can’t call bullshit on someone who tells you they’re going to do it too.</p>

<p>And sure, people who’ve never built anything in their lives will write words &amp; fill up paper with splotches of ink critiquing the people actually in the arena.</p>

<p>And yet “the dogs bark, but the caravan goes on.”</p>

<p>Even in the face of regulatory incompetence, the jealousy of the paper belt, and the false narrative of a “big tech” backlash, the valley goes on making new things that are loved and used by regular people all over the world.</p>

<h6>The Most Wonderful Time of History</h6>

<p>A coworker and I were at dinner a few weeks ago and he made a point that stuck with me: of all the times in history one could be alive – during the Roman Empire, or the Industrial Revolution, or the Renaissance – we got to be alive during the Technological Revolution. </p>

<p>The most impactful and influential time in the history of humanity.</p>

<p>What isn’t amazing and special about that? Just writing that sentence makes me want to run and tell everyone to come over and join the historical ride. </p>

<p>When work is going to fill so much of your life, why not do something as meaningful as the rest of your life.</p>

<h6><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2010/05/15/steve-jobs-to-valleywag-why-are-you-so-bitter/">Steve Jobs Quote That Inspired Today’s Newsletter</a></h6>

<p>Steve and a journalist emailed each other back and forth at 2 in the morning about whether Apple should allow Flash on the iPad. It’s worth reading the whole exchange. </p>

<p>The final line from Steve sums up a large portion of my worldview:</p>

<p>“By the way, what have you done that’s so great? Do you create anything, or just criticize others work and belittle their motivations?”</p>

<h6><a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/basic">Being Basic as a Virtue</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“If producing ideas becomes a symbol of work (having to think about stuff all day), rather than leisure (freedom to think about stuff all day), I wonder whether basic behavior will start to become covetable. Instead of signaling how much we’re thinking, maybe we’ll start to signal how much we’re not thinking.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://medium.com/@malay/building-a-big-health-tech-company-76f51ab4da64#.vxpaeo6qf">Building a Big Health Tech Company</a> (article)</h6>

<p>I’ve been reading about the healthcare industry the last few weeks. Like many big problems, it seems like everyone’s describing a different part of the elephant. </p>

<p>I like this article because it points out the size of the market that incumbents own vs what the most successful startups have captured. The gap is still almost the entire industry.</p>

<p>My bet on the biggest innovations will be full stuck, where the company owns the entire user experience. Something I’d like to see more of is how to align the incentives of the payer, whether the insurance company or the end user, with the provider. Seeing the power of income share agreements at Lambda has been transformational in understanding what the alignment of incentives can do.</p>

<h6><a href="https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/">What is Amazon?</a> (article)</h6>

<p>A classic.</p>

<p>Today Amazon is built on the foundation of something Jeff Bezos declared internally in 2002:</p>

<p>“1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through interfaces, 2) teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces, 3) all interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be exposed to developers in the outside world, and 4) anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired.”</p>
