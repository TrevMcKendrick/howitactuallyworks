<h3>The Joy Of Fulfilling Promises to Yourself</h3>

<p>I’ve been running a lot lately, and it sucks.</p>

<p>I’m out of shape, I’m slow (11:00 minutes/miles), it’s 95 degrees in Peak Sweaty Balls Houston Humidity, and I don’t see a near-term end game. </p>

<p>It’s just suffering.</p>

<p>After every run I post to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trevmckendrick/">personal Instagram</a> a pic of the run and my time.</p>

<p>A friend recently commented on a run, “You have a particular fitness goal you&#39;re working towards?”</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> run to try and lose weight. If this body at age 33 is my peak physical form then I’m totally screwed for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>I could also be running for a charity, or to support a sick friend, or any number of other wholesome &amp; practical reasons.</p>

<p>But what I told my friend instead was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Blb23tfgd7x/?taken-by=trevmckendrick">“each run is its own reward.”</a></p>

<p>The point isn’t to suffer so I can achieve some other arbitrary goal in the future. Or to pass some mental goalpost I’ve set where “I’ll be happy when I have <em>fill in the blank here</em>.” </p>

<p>Overcoming all the pain &amp; the suffering &amp; the struggle... that’s the point. </p>

<p>To say “I did it”. To tell myself I’m going to do something, and then to keep that promise to myself and do it.</p>

<p>The personal satisfaction that one gains from keeping personal promises is reward enough.</p>
