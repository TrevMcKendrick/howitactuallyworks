<h3>Pain is the Point</h3>

<p>This is an online archive of an essay from my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. If you'd like to read more material like this for free <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com">give me your email here</a>.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently sold some of his ownership in his startup. He’s a family man &amp; had loans on a few of his cars, so the first thing he did with his money was pay off the loans.</p>

<p>He could have made the final payment online of course. But instead, to celebrate he drove to each of the banks &amp; paid in person.</p>

<p>Friend: “Hi I’d like to pay off my car loan”</p>

<p>Teller: <em>Not an every day occurrence so doesn’t understand</em> Of course sir let me look up what your payment is this month.</p>

<p>F: Oh, actually I’d just like to pay off the entire balance.</p>

<p>T: Ah well then, let me look up how much that is…. you’ll need to pay $XX,XXX.</p>

<p>F: Great, thanks. <em>writes 5 figure check, hands to teller, walks out of bank with 1 less debt to worry about. Goes to a 2nd bank and repeats</em></p>

<p>Of course this felt good to my friend, but why?</p>

<p><strong>His material life had changed ZERO.</strong></p>

<p>He still owned the same cars, in the same condition, and yet it was such a significant event that he wanted to physically experience it in person. </p>

<p>He even took his son.</p>

<h6>Goals are Paths</h6>

<p>Goals are overrated. Not because they aren’t important but because they’re marketed as destinations.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to start a successful business &amp; become rich.</p>

<p>You’ll quickly find that a million annoying &amp; seemingly irrelevant things get in your way. Customers ignore you. You can’t hire anyone. Things break.</p>

<p>And the whole time you’re thinking “why can’t things just work out so I can get back to building my company!”</p>

<p>The problem is you’re seeing the goal as a destination in the future when really a goal is a path.</p>

<p>A goal is a selection of problems you’ve chosen to overcome in order to give meaning &amp; purpose to your life.</p>

<p>This paradigm helps in myriad ways. When we no longer view goals as destinations pain becomes a meaningful part of the path instead of being an obstacle that gets in the way.</p>

<p>Pain can then be expected &amp; embraced, not scary &amp; averted.</p>

<h6>Pain is the Point</h6>

<p>How you obtain an asset changes what it means to you. </p>

<p>For example, why is it so much cooler to drive an expensive car you purchased than a similar car that was given to you?</p>

<p><strong>Because you earned it.</strong></p>

<p>Because you sacrificed &amp; took risks. You worked when others were having fun.</p>

<p>And it’s this – overcoming problems, sacrificing for a greater cause, working with others – that gives our lives meaning.</p>

<p>Because my friend paying off his debt, or you buying your dream home… those are just physical representations of what you’ve accomplished, not the accomplishment itself.</p>

<p>And the pain you endure to get there is what makes the goal worth doing in the first place.</p>

<p>“I started a billion-dollar company, but I have friends who started ten-billion-dollar companies, thirty-billion-dollar companies. And those guys are looking up at Zuck, and that guy’s probably looking at Steve Jobs and being like, ‘I wish I was Steve Jobs.’ And Steve Jobs is fucking dead.”</p>

<p>The entire series is underrated IMO. This link is to the episode with Alec Baldwin, which has a great bit about why people struggle to break into show business.</p>

<p>See also the episodes with Will Ferrell, Kevin Hart, and Ellen.</p>
