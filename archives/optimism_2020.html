<h3>Optimism2020: A Manifesto</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<h2>Choosing Optimism</h2>

<p>I’d received some feedback from coworkers last year that I could perhaps be a little more positive. So in early January, before Corona had presented itself as a significant threat, I created a personal slogan for the year. </p>

<p>I called it <strong>Optimism2020</strong>.</p>

<p>I was so sick of hearing about the presidential election, so I wanted to create my <em>own</em> kind of campaign for 2020. </p>

<p>A campaign to change my own thinking.</p>

<p>I’ve always felt like one needs to be able to <em>justify</em> their optimism. Which is stupid… the whole point of optimism is being able to think and dream beyond whatever your current situation is.</p>

<p>But I wasn’t mentally there yet, so I created Optimism2020 as a personal rallying call that would <em>give me an excuse to be positive. </em></p>

<p>And now it turns out 2020 is quite the freaking year to start actively choosing to be optimistic. It’s like the pessimist’s nightmare become real… “the one time I try and be positive LOOK WHAT HAPPENS.”</p>

<p>Which honestly makes it the <strong>best</strong> possible time to increase one’s optimism. What better test for choosing optimism than the biggest worldwide crisis in possibly a hundred years.</p>

<p>To that end, I wanted to make <strong>Optimism2020</strong> official today and announce it to the world.</p>

<p>And so I created the below manifesto.</p>

<h2>Optimism2020: A Manifesto</h2>

<p>Optimism2020 means focusing our time &amp; attention on the things we can influence.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means doing something today instead of daydreaming about tomorrow.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means seeing problems as opportunities to learn, grow, and give meaning to our lives. </p>

<p>Optimism2020 means keeping promises to yourself, no matter how small. Telling yourself you’ll go on a walk and then doing it. Promising to call a friend, and doing it. Telling your boss you’ll send that email, and doing it. </p>

<p>Optimism2020 means yes that thing of yours just broke, but believing you’ll be able to figure out how to fix it.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means carefully choosing the stories you tell yourself about who you are and what you’re capable of.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means moving fast. Most decisions can be reversed later.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 is someone asking you how you’re doing, and earnestly replying “great!”</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means being you. Not because you’re entitled to be heard but because there is some unique thing you have to offer, if you can find it.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means believing we can think, and build, and create ourselves out of any problem.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means knowing that the pie is not fixed, that life is not zero sum.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means focusing on why something could work instead of why it won’t.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means seeing yourself as part of the solution, not a victim of the problem.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means paying for the drive thru order of the car behind you.</p>

<p>Optimism2020 means seeing problems as temporary and specific, not permanent and expansive. </p>

<p>Optimism2020 means believing problems are solvable. Maybe not right away, probably not easily, but that <strong>it can be done.</strong></p>
