<h3>New Years Resolutions Are Garbage (but you shouldn't listen to me)</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>Good luck in 2020. Calling it right now: it’s gonna be an insane year.</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<h6>New Years Resolutions Are Garbage (but you shouldn&#39;t listen to me)</h6>

<p>I hate new years resolutions. I’ve always been of the thinking that if you actually want to change yourself, you can do it whenever. Why remove your agency by relying on an arbitrary social deadline?</p>

<p>You know what else I hate? Being one of those people who signs up for a gym membership in January. Full of aspiration but not follow through. Gyms are full of hope and promise for a few weeks in January while the gym regulars on Twitter ruthlessly mock the people who will inevitably stop going.</p>

<p>And you know what? Tell people like me to go fuck themselves.</p>

<p>If you have something that works for you, just do it. </p>

<p>If you want to do your thing, go do it. </p>

<p>Ignore the judgment of the crowds, ignore the haters, ignore any perceived embarrassment. </p>

<p>The person who runs for even 30 seconds today has infinitely more bragging rights than the person who just bought running shoes online.</p>

<p>The world needs more people who don’t care what other people think. If new years resolutions are in vogue, or aren’t, who cares. You do you.</p>

<h6><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life is short</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“When I ask myself what I&#39;ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is ‘bullshit.’ I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It&#39;s almost the definition of bullshit that it&#39;s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There&#39;s something fake about it. It&#39;s the junk food of experience.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://overcast.fm/+Q4m7_Q2Tg">How to get rich</a> (podcast)</h6>

<p>Naval Ravikant turned his <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?s=20">“how to get rich without getting lucky” tweetstorm (which you should also read)</a> into a bunch of mini podcast episodes (think 2-3 minutes talking about each tweet). He then combined all of those into a single audio file, which is what I linked to.</p>

<p>Great listen, over 3 hours long, flows really well.</p>

<h6><a href="https://whatever.scalzi.com/2019/12/26/thoughts-on-a-year-of-exercise/">Thoughts on a year of exercise</a> (article)</h6>

<p>An honest take from a 50 year old who lost 30 pounds this year. tldr: He still dislikes exercising, came to terms that exercising is the new normal at his age, and discovered that getting physically and mentally fit didn’t solve the rest of his life’s problems.</p>

<p>Maybe that all sounds super obvious, but I almost always find reading someone else’s take on how they did something difficult worth reading. I wish more people did this for something like career or entrepreneurial success.</p>

<h6><a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1210777243967901701">Thread of inspiring music</a> (tweetstorm)</h6>

<p>Thread of people talking about what music gives them a sense of awe at the universe.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.albertbridgecapital.com/drew-views/2019/6/17/stay-in-the-game">A story about a dog who gets hit by a car</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Feel good story that will make you feel better about humanity.</p>
