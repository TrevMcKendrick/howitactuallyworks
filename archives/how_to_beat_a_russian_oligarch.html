<h3>How to Beat a Russian Oligarch</h3>

<p>This is an online archive of an essay from my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. If you'd like to read more material like this for free <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com">give me your email here</a>.</p>

<p>Bill Browder had hired 15 Israeli military guards and 5 security guards to project himself in Moscow.</p>

<p>He was a British citizen who’d made a fortune investing in Russia in the 90s. So much that he’d become <strong>the largest foreign investor in Russia.</strong></p>

<p>This created a problem.</p>

<p>Because the rule of law is so weak in Russia, <strong>being a businessman is similar to being an inmate in a prison yard. </strong></p>

<p>Your reputation is the <em>only thing that matters</em>, so as a Russian oligarch you do <strong>everything</strong> to increase it.</p>

<p>Including trying to steal $87 million from the largest foreign investor in Russia.</p>

<h6>Dilution</h6>

<p>That’s what one Russian Oligarch named <em>Potanin</em> tried to do.</p>

<p>His scheme’s details only matter to show you <strong>how brazen he was</strong>:</p>

<p>The plan was to issue new shares in a company that he and Browder already shared ownership in. Normally as an owner you simply buy some of the new shares so you don’t get diluted.</p>

<p>Instead Potanin made an explicit rule that <strong>any investor could buy the new shares except for Browder.</strong></p>

<h6>The Sit Down</h6>

<p>As soon as Browder finds out he goes in to meet with Potanin’s chief lieutenant to find out WTF is going on.</p>

<p>After waiting hours to see the guy this amazing conversation goes down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian: What brings you here today?</p>

<p>Browder: You know what. I’m here to talk about the company.</p>

<p>R: Yes. What about it?</p>

<p>B: If this dilution goes forward, <em>it’s going to cost me and my investors millions. </em></p>

<p>R: Yes, we know. <strong>That’s the intention Bill.</strong></p>

<p>B: What??</p>

<p>R: That’s the intention.</p>

<p>B: <strong>You’re deliberately trying to screw me?</strong></p>

<p>R: <strong>Yes.</strong></p>

<p>B: How? It’s illegal!</p>

<p>R: <strong>This is Russia. Do you think we worry about these types of things?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point any normal foreigner would back down. Foreigners in Russia had been killed over far less.</p>

<p>Not Browder. He started making plans:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re going to fight these bastards. We’re going to go to war.</p>
</blockquote>

<h6>Stage 1: Tell The Russian’s Friends</h6>

<p>Browder’s first move is to call every Western business partner of Potanin.</p>

<p>This included people like George Soros and the Harvard endowment fund.</p>

<p>Browder’s pitch was simple: <strong>if you let Potanin get away with this with me, he’ll eventually do it to you.</strong></p>

<p>These Western organizations did make some calls to Potanin and it did piss him off that Browder was talking to Potanin’s investors, but he didn’t budge.</p>

<p>No way he’d let himself get pushed around by a <em>foreigner</em>.</p>

<h6>Stage 2: Make it Public</h6>

<p>Browder then met with the Moscow bureau chief of the Financial Times. She was an expat and had been looking for a big story on an oligarch.</p>

<p>She wrote up the detailed saga and gave Potanin a chance to comment. </p>

<p>He used the opportunity to double down(!), saying Browder <em>should have known he’d get screwed</em>, and that it was his own damn fault(!!)</p>

<p>The Financial Times story got picked up everywhere: the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, all the usual Western suspects. The share dilution issue became <em>the</em> topic in Russian financial market gossip.</p>

<h6>Stage 3: The Enemy of Your Enemy is Your Friend</h6>

<p>Browder’s final move was to appeal to the Russian government itself. </p>

<p>Amazingly it worked, and they shut down the share issuance. </p>

<p>But only because Browder had given the government cover. He said as much:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason [Vasiliev, the chair of the Russian SEC] made the decision [to shut it down] is that I was screaming bloody murder. Nobody had ever taken such a visible and outspoken position. <strong>I was shooting from the trenches and this gave him cover to take his own steps. </strong><br/><br/>You have to remember that … oligarchs owned the government and <strong>Vasiliev was worried about terrible things happening to him, professionally or even worse</strong>. By not initiating but responding to an attack, he felt more empowered to act. <br/><br/><strong>He asked us on a number of occasions to raise specific points in the press</strong>, because he couldn’t go on the offensive until something came out publicly. <strong>He was clear that he couldn’t be seen as initiating but responding. </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good for Browder but you still have to ask: why didn’t Potanin just go ahead and kill Browder anyway?</p>

<p>The social dynamic here is important: because the <strong>government</strong> was the final organization to stop the issuance (instead of Browder himself) <em>it gave Potanin a way to save face.</em></p>

<p>It’s like if you’re in a prison fight with another inmate and an officer comes to break it up.</p>

<p>No one “loses” so no one’s reputation takes a hit.</p>

<p>Remember to give your enemies a way to save face if you want something from them.</p>
