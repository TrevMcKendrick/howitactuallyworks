<h3>Book Recommendations That Have Nothing to do with Corona</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Hi all, what a week it’s been.</p>

<p>Because we’re all cooped up and (at least for me) so tired of reading and hearing about Corona, this week I’m ignoring Corona altogether and making only book recommendations.</p>

<p>I hope they take your mind off of the virus and give you something to enjoy while you wait out this modern adventure.</p>

<p>Have a great week.</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful-dp-1451639619/dp/1451639619/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a></h6>

<p>This is a philosophy book about values dressed up as a self help book.</p>

<p>While philosophers have talked for thousands of years on “how to live” or what is “the good life”, the 7 Habits actually gives detailed, specific answers to those questions that, I think, will pass the test of time better than almost any other book.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passage-Power-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0375713255">The Passage of Power</a></h6>

<p>Robert Caro’s 4th book in his (still unfinished) 5 book Lyndon Johnson series.</p>

<p>This is my favorite of the bunch because it details the transition of Lyndon from powerless Vice President through Kennedy’s assassination and Lyndon using that momentum and unity to pass various civil rights acts. It also gives you enough of Lyndon’s history so you still feel like you’re getting to know what made him.</p>

<p>If I could recommend only 1 book from the series this would be it.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness-ebook/dp/B078MDSV8T">The Courage to Be Disliked</a></h6>

<p>A book about, among other things, whether you can choose to be happy. This is an easy read and is one of my most highlighted Kindle books. Some of my favorite quotes:</p>

<p><em>“When receiving praise becomes one’s goal, one is choosing a way of living that is in line with another person’s system of values”</em></p>

<p><em>“The greatest life-lie of all is to not live here and now. It is to look at the past and the future, cast a dim light on one’s entire life, and believe that one has been able to see something.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: You should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.”</em></p>

<h6><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032">The Three Body Problem</a></h6>

<p>I consume very little fiction these days, but the best fiction I do get into seems to motivate and inspire me far more than the best non fiction. Such was the case with this book.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DYGOO6">Bowling Alone</a></h6>

<p>“Drawing on vast new data that reveal Americans&#39; changing behavior, Putnam shows how we have become increasingly disconnected from one another and how social structures -- whether they be PTA, church, or political parties -- have disintegrated. Until the publication of this groundbreaking work, no one had so deftly diagnosed the harm that these broken bonds have wreaked on our physical and civic health, nor had anyone exalted their fundamental power in creating a society that is happy, healthy, and safe.”</p>

<p>This book is remarkable because it describes all of the above… and it was published in August 2001. Pre modern Internet and all the narratives that come with it.</p>
