<p>Happy Monday!</p>

<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="https://standardebooks.org">Standard Ebooks</a></h6>

<p>A bunch of high quality, public-domain ebooks. </p>

<p>There’s lots of sites with free public domain ebooks, but this is the highest quality one I’ve see, by a long shot.</p>

<h6><a href="https://playbook.samaltman.com">Startup Playbook</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Bunch of good startup advice from Sam Altman. See also one of my all time favorites: <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful">How to Be Successful</a></p>

<h6><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/free-speech-cliches-media-should-stop-using/596506/">Don’t Use These Free-Speech Arguments Ever Again</a> (article)</h6>

<p>A list of arguments that people make against free speech law that aren’t true.</p>

<h6><a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/02/22/aligning-business-models-to-markets/">Aligning Business Models to Markets</a> (article)</h6>

<p>Basically: you’ll put the wind at your back if you choose a business model that aligns with your strategy. E.g. Danny Meyer (founder of places like Shake Shack) investing in quality service by spending time/money training employees, and giving employees a possible career progression within the company.</p>

<h6><a href="">You’re Only Human</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“We are the humans! We are the ones who write, who speak, who invent! We are the strange chimps who always found a way to thrive, on every corner of this ridiculous planet, no matter what it threw at us!”</p>
