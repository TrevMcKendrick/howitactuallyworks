<h3>Identity Change</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Hello and good morning! I hope you had a great January.</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<h6>What's your version of cigarettes?</h6>

<p>What’s something that’s repulsive to you? Or something you just have no interest in trying?</p>

<p>Mine is cigarettes. It’s not just a lack of curiosity, it’s a total repulsion to the idea of even trying them. Being in a room where smokers frequent is pretty rough for me.</p>

<p>Some people feel the same way about soda, or other high sugar foods. They just won’t tolerate them, to the point of avoiding the types of environments where those foods are considered normal.</p>

<p>Other people feel that way about missing a workout. It’s P0, every day. The idea of missing a workout is absurd to the point of laughter.</p>

<p>You get the picture.</p>

<p>The point is that if you want to avoid some bad habit, the goal should be to make it as repulsive to you as cigarettes are to me. It’s not just that I don’t want to smoke a cigarette, it’s that the idea is so foreign it literally never even occurs to me why I would want to do such a thing.</p>

<p>And why couldn’t your bad habit be given the same revulsion? What’s stopping you? You can always choose to see yourself as a new type of person, who doesn’t do that thing. Who’s offended by it. This is a mental game you have to play with yourself. Change your identity, and you’ll change your behavior.</p>

<p>I don’t mean this as snark: Tim Ferriss is so good at humblebrag marketing I’m in awe. </p>

<p>Here he gets to write a super interesting article about all the problems that arise with semi-fame, while also dropping multiple times how many people follow him.</p>

<p>Read this both for the interesting fame takeaways and also on how to organically put up a big flex.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.luca-dellanna.com/solving-the-sources-of-your-problems/">Solving the source of your problems</a> (article)</h6>

<p>This is full of great one liners:</p>

<p>“Everything which you did today which took time away from what you wanted to do to improve yourself and your condition is an addiction, and has to be treated accordingly. Denying this truth will prevent you from realizing your addiction is a source of problems, and has to be treated first.”</p>

<p>“When you are starting something, your goal should be consistency.”</p>

<p>“There is always a step, no matter how small, which can be done towards what you want to achieve, and there is no excuse for not taking it today.”</p>

<p>See my related post: <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com/archives/future_you_masturbation.html">Future You Masturbation</a>.</p>

<p>The solution to almost any life problem is to fall in love with the process, not the goal. </p>

<p>More to say here but: the best businesses often see money as an output, but not an end, of what they do. See: Apple, Disney, etc. </p>

<p>The same follow for people: noticing the distance between where you are and where you want to be will just constantly make you miserable. Instead, make whatever the change process is part of who you are – change your identity – and inevitably you will reach the original goal and go much past it.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyXnilND0XM">Kobe interview</a> (2 minutes, youtube)</h6>

<p>Interviewer: “What drive you to come back? [after a serious injury]”</p>

<p>Kobe: “The process of it. I wanna see if I can. I don’t know if I can. I didn’t know if I could come back from that. I wanted to find out.... [and] I’m gonna do what I always do, which is break everything down to its smallest form, its smallest detail, and go after it.”</p>
