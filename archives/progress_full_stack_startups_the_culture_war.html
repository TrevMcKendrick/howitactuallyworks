<h3>Progress, Full Stack Startups, and the Culture War</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I’m in DC most of this week for work. Hope you have a great week.</p>

<p>Trevor</p>

<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/progress-studies-a-moral-imperative">“To care about human life and happiness is to see progress as a moral imperative.”</a> (article)</h6>

<p>From my friend Jason Crawford. An addition to the Progress Studies that Tyler Cowen and Patrick Collison <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">published about a few weeks ago.</a></p>

<h6><a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/03/15/full-stack-startups/">Full Stack Startups</a> (article)</h6>

<p>From Chris Dixon, the original (I think?) articulate of “full stack startups”. The old way: make dispatch software and sell it to taxi companies. The new way: keep the dispatch software you built and provide the transportation service yourself straight to the end consumer, a la Uber.</p>

<p>See also Chris’s post on “<a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/10/20/for-every-new-good-idea-you-have-there-ten-thousand-foolish-ones/">the great ideas have come from people who weren’t paid to have great ideas</a>.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">Time Management by Randy Pausch</a> (article + video)</h6>

<p>You might remember Randy as the the Carnegie Mellon instructor who was diagnosed w/ terminal cancer and then gave a famous talk.</p>

<p>This is another talk he gave around the same time. <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">The slides alone</a> are interesting to go through if you don’t have time for the full talk.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html">I Was Caroline Calloway</a> (article)</h6>

<p>I’d never heard of Caroline (or the author) until this found me. She’s not that interesting and isn’t the reason to read this. What makes this sad and noteworthy is watching her friend (the author) do most of the real work while enduring Caroline’s mistreatment and semi fake friendship. I feel genuinely bad for her, and yet she could have left at any time. She’s not the first to get trapped by thinking they’re on the path to greatness.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/when-the-culture-war-comes-for-the-kids/596668/">When the Culture War Comes for the Kids</a> (article)</h6>

<p>What happens when public schools focus on identity more than actual life experience, excellence, and even truth. One of the most depressing things I’ve read in a long time… I almost feel guilty in sharing it with you:</p>

<p>“As part of the initiative, Carranza has mandated anti-bias training for every employee of the school system, at a cost of $23 million. One training slide was titled “White Supremacy Culture.” It included “Perfectionism,” “Individualism,” “Objectivity,” and “Worship of the Written Word” among the white-supremacist values that need to be disrupted. In the name of exposing racial bias, the training created its own kind.”</p>

<p>This is an example of what makes me more optimistic about red states.</p>
