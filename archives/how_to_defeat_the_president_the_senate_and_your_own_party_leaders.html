<h3>How to Defeate the President, the Senate, and your Party Leaders</h3>

<p>Give me 4 minutes &amp; I&#39;ll show you how then <strong>Senator Lyndon B. Johnson</strong> beat <strong>President Truman</strong> &amp; the Democratic Party leadership in not confirming <strong>Leland Olds</strong> to a 3rd term on the Federal Power Comission (FPC).</p>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re the new Senator Lyndon B. Johnson in 1949 &amp; you need to prove to your Texas oil donors that you&#39;re on their team. (You&#39;re a Democrat after all.)</p>

<p>To prove your loyalty you&#39;re given an assignment: stop the Presidential appointee Leland Olds from being confirmed to a 3rd consecutive 5-year term as a Federal Power Commissioner.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have much power yourself yet; you&#39;ve only been in the Senate for less than a year.</p>

<p>How do you get the entire Senate, with a strong Democratic majority, to vote <em>against</em> an appointment from a <em>Democratic</em> President? </p>

<p>You can&#39;t tip your hand on your plan too early but you also need to make sure you get credit at the end.</p>

<p>How do you do this?</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>The first thing Johnson did was focus on what he could control: he didn&#39;t have sway in the Senate, but he was a member of the committee that would vote whether to recommend Olds to the Senate.</p>

<p>He then asked the committee chairman for two things:</p>

<p>1) To be the chair of the <em>sub</em>committee doing the actual investigation</p>

<p>2) To allow the subcommitee to hold the hearings</p>

<p>He was granted both.</p>

<p>Next, he dug up as much &quot;dirt&quot; on Olds as possible. Olds was a very liberal type who&#39;d written articles for wire services that had ended up being published in places like <em>The Daily Worker.</em> He&#39;d had some pretty radical views for the time, including nationalization of some power companies.</p>

<p>Johnson&#39;s team went through over 1,800 articles Olds had written and selected 54 to enter as evidence. They highlighted paragraphs and sentences that made Olds look particularly bad.</p>

<p>LBJ also took time to personally interview potential witnesses to see whether they&#39;d be a good fit for the hearings. (And once he&#39;d selected the witnesses he even coached some of them on what to say in their testimony.)</p>

<p>And, at the last minute, he changed the members of the subcommittee. </p>

<p>He increased the membership from 5 to 7 people, knowing that since 7 was a majority in the <em>actual</em> committee, whatever the subcommittee decided would be what the committee recommended to the Senate itself.</p>

<p>Johnson recognized this &amp; knew the power of inertia. By dominating the subcommittee he was able to scope the confirmation to a place where he had control.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once the hearings started Johnson employed a bunch of unpleasant tactics:</p>

<p>1) He constantly interruped Olds, demaind yes/no answers to complicated questions. If Olds didn&#39;t give the answer he wanted, Johnson would interrupt and ask for a yes/no response.</p>

<p>2) Johnson made Olds look like a fool by asking him to show documentation to prove he&#39;d resigned from the communist-connected American Labor Party.</p>

<p>Asking for details &amp; proof is demeaning and undermines authority. E.g. see the reaction to asking for Obama&#39;s birth certificate. The <em>request</em> is what does the damage.</p>

<p>3) Johnson made sure to hide that he&#39;d coached some witnesses: when he called their names to give testimony he acted as if he didn&#39;t know or even recognize them.</p>

<p>4) Johnson tried to get Olds to confess to having communist points of view by using free speech as his &quot;good cop&quot;: &quot;You have a right to say that &amp; thank God in this country a man can still exercise some free speech&quot;</p>

<p>By controlling the witnesses and the hearing Johnson was able to get headlines like this:</p>

<p>INSERT HEADLINE</p>

<p>The committee voted 10-2 not to recommend Olds&#39;. </p>

<p>The final vote would take place in the Senate itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the end Johnson needed credit for all this, so once they were in the Senate itself he gave a strong speech against Olds that included the famous line: &quot;Shall we have a commissioner or a commissar?&quot;</p>

<p>President Truman and other Democrats tried to use their support to win back the confirmation but it was too late: the Senate voted 53-15 not to confirm.</p>
