<h3>Say No, Sensitive Questions, and Investors vs Operators</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://www.howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I keep a list of favorite quotes. Here’s a few for you this week:</p>

<p>“I never know if I can handle anything. That’s what makes my life so exciting.” - Todd, from Bojack Horseman</p>

<p>“When you view the world as a series of outputs you form opinions. But when you view the world as a series of mechanisms you form strategies.” - Channing Allen</p>

<p>“May you live all the days of your life.” - Jonathan Swift</p>

<p>“To live in the past is to die in the present.” - Bill Belichick</p>

<p>“Maybe the most important restraints on a person would be not external to them, but might exist in their own mind.” - Tara Westover, <em>Educated</em></p>

<p>“Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then, by God, do something. Don&#39;t just stand there, make it happen.” - Lee Iacocca</p>

<p>“Luck never sent a few hundred emails, wrote an autoresponder, handled a contract negotiation, etc, but both people who do these things and people who don’t do these things attribute a good deal of their outcomes to it.” Patrick McKenzie (patio11)</p>

<p>A list of straightforward ways to say no to things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Informational meetings</li>
  <li>Interviews of candidates (that don’t get hired)</li>
  <li>1-1s with former reports</li>
  <li>Difficult conversations</li>
  <li>1-1s that are not functional</li>
  <li>Group meetings that are not functional</li>
</ul>

<h6><a href="https://hiaw-images.s3.amazonaws.com/SSRN-id3437468.pdf">The Cost of Avoiding Sensitive Questions</a> (PDF study)</h6>

<p>“Across three pilot studies and four experimental studies, we demonstrate that individuals avoid asking sensitive questions, because they fear making others uncomfortable and because of impression management concerns. We demonstrate that this aversion to asking sensitive questions is both costly and misguided. Even when we incentivized participants to ask sensitive questions, participants were reluctant to do so in both face-to-face and computer-mediated chat conversations. Interestingly, <strong>rather than accurately anticipating how sensitive questions will influence impression formation, we find that question askers significantly overestimate the interpersonal costs of asking sensitive questions</strong>. “</p>

<p>I didn’t read this whole thing but I think studying unwritten social norms and rules is really interesting. I also think the best and most interesting conversations often come from asking questions that most people are afraid to bring up.</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.adventur.es/investors-and-operators-lessons-ive-learned-from-both-worlds">Investors &amp; Operators: Lessons I’ve Learned from Both Worlds</a> (article)</h6>

<p>From Brent Beshore, the founder/CEO of Adventures:</p>

<p>“Good investors aren’t always good business people and good business people don’t always light it up as investors. My experience has been that people can make a whole lot of money without knowing much about managing it and that others can know a whole lot about managing money without understanding how operating companies amass it.”</p>

<p>Adventures has stumbled in to a lower mid market PE firm. Their capital structure alone sets them apart from typical PE firms.</p>

<h6><a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/">Debunking the Silly “Passive Investing is a Bubble” Myth</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“Indexing is an odd risk to worry about. It’s bizarre that some people think it’s a bad thing investors are shifting money into funds that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>save them money in fees</li>
  <li>are more tax-efficient</li>
  <li>have lower turnover and trading costs</li>
  <li>beat the majority of actively managed funds over the long-term</li>
  <li>are simpler and easier to understand than most investment strategies”</li>
</ul>
