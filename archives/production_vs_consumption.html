<h3>Production vs Consumption</h3>

<p>This is an online archive of an essay from my weekly newsletter <em>How It Actually Works</em>. If you'd like to read more material like this for free <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com">give me your email here</a>.</p>

<p>One of my life goals is to build a saloon.</p>

<p>I have it all spec’d out: the swinging doors, the antique bar, the old player piano with Scott Joplin ragtime music… you get the idea.</p>

<p>Making this thing is going to be a colossal undertaking. Untold hours of planning, attending antique shows in Mississippi to find suitable furniture, coordinating with random vendors, etc.</p>

<p>It’s not even a business, it’s just a neat thing I want to exist so I can have people over for a party occasionally.</p>

<p>And yet if someone offered to give me exactly what I wanted, built for free and with no effort from me, would I accept it?</p>

<p>Hell no.</p>

<h6>Now What?</h6>

<p>Imagine that everything you’ve ever wanted – an impressive house, a beautiful body, a Tesla, whatever – was suddenly given to you for free.</p>

<p>Would that make you happy?</p>

<p>You’d be pretty stoked for a few days. You might show off your new wares to some friends, maybe take a vacation or relax with some pink lemonade on your new front porch.</p>

<p>But what about after that?</p>

<p>Even in this imaginary world where you have everything you’ve ever wanted, when you wake up in the morning you still have to decide <em>what the hell am I going to do today?</em></p>

<p>This isn’t a trite question, because if you don’t have a good answer you’re going to become miserable, fast.</p>

<h6>Buying vs Building</h6>

<p>Somewhere in life we’re taught that happiness is based on <strong>consumption</strong>: owning, having, buying.</p>

<p><em>“As soon as I have that car/house/body I’ll be happy.”</em></p>

<p>Instead of consumption, happiness is found in the quest of <strong>production</strong>: building, creating, making. Solving problems.</p>

<p>If you skip straight to having everything, to maximum consumption, you miss out on the satisfaction that comes from the path of struggle you’d have to endure to get there.</p>

<h3>Do vs Have</h3>

<p>Looking for something you can do instead of something you can have is a fundamentally better way to live life.</p>

<p><strong>It gives you your agency back.</strong> </p>

<p>So much of modern life is merely keeping score on who has the best stuff.</p>

<p>We even have a phrase for this, “the haves and have-nots”. </p>

<p>That so much of one’s personal life pursuits can be determined by what <strong>other people own</strong> is a true WTF idea.</p>

<p>It’s like some sick prisoner’s dilemma where the whole time you’re in jail there’s a key sitting next to you to get out if you’d only take the time to notice it.</p>

<p>Focusing on <em>do</em> empowers you: you can work on whatever you want.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying about never being able to afford the same size house as your brother-in-law, you can work on what you control.</p>

<p>You can build something today. You can solve problems today. You can invest in your relationships today.</p>

<p>No matter how much someone else has, you can always <em>do</em>.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor, whether you’re 95 or 18, or what your current job is. There’s always things to build and problems to solve.</p>

<p>Removing what your possess from your identity is liberating.</p>

<h3>No Saloon For You</h3>

<p>The satisfaction you feel about some part of your life is often relative to the amount of work that went into it. This is why, for example, being a parent can be so universally meaningful: it’s a lot of freaking work.</p>

<p>Which is also why I don’t want a free Saloon. Any joy it gives me will come from making it, not owning it.</p>

<p><strong><em>“Why are there so many successful startups in Stockholm?</em></strong></p>

<p>“London and Paris have surprisingly few successful tech startups for their size. Stockholm, a city of less than 1 million people, has Spotify, King, Klarna, iZettle, and Mojang, all valued at more than $1 billion. What&#39;s true of Stockholm that isn&#39;t true of other European cities? (Provo may be the US Stockholm and some similar questions apply there.)”<em>
