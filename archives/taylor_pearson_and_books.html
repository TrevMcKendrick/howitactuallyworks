<h2>The Links</h2>

<h6><a href="https://www.tommycollison.com/books">Recommended Books from Tommy Collison</a> (list)</h6>

<h6><a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/without-fail/the-tragedy-expert#episode-player">The Tragedy Expert</a> (podcast)</h6>

<p>Listened to this on a plane.</p>

<p>“In the days after September 11, 2001, Kenneth Feinberg took on an unenviable task. Congress had created the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and it was his job to figure out who should receive money and how much they should get. But much of his time was spent doing something else: listening to people’s stories. Nearly two decades later, he’s still the person we turn to in the wake of our worst catastrophes.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-breaking-up-big-tech-would-be-a-big-mistake/">Breaking up Big Tech Would Be a Big Mistake</a> (article)</h6>

<p>“Let’s start with this: Neither Google nor Facebook, the two tech companies that receive the most criticism, are a true monopoly.”</p>

<h6><a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1116126540574543872.html">Taylor Pearson’s Most Popular Twitter Threads</a> (post)</h6>

<p>Includes: </p>

<p>1) how to decide what to optimize your life for</p>

<p>2) the books that most influenced him</p>

<p>3) summary of the book Finite and Infinite Games</p>

<p>4) how to stop procrastinating</p>

<h6><a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1117063944592609280">Quote from Paul Graham</a></h6>

<p>“Experts share something in common with conspiracy theorists: they see patterns where other people just see random data. The difference, of course, is that experts are correct. But I bet part of the attraction of conspiracy theories is that they make you feel like an expert”</p>
