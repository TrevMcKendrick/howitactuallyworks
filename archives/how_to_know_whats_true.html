<h3>How to Know What's True</h3>

<p>This was originally published in my free weekly newsletter, <a href="https://howitactuallyworks.com"><em>How It Actually Works</em></a>.</p>

<p>Almost everything we know about the world we didn’t learn from the original source.</p>

<p>For example I haven’t done the primary research to prove that protons &amp; electrons exist but I take them for granted because I trust the institutions that taught me: schools, science, etc.</p>

<p>The issue is that today we get so much information that doesn’t come from the old, filtered hierarchies that existed pre-Internet.</p>

<p><strong>So we have to be really careful about who we choose to listen to.</strong></p>

<h6>From Hierarchy to Networks</h6>

<p>When you read something new consider what path it took to get to you. </p>

<p>Like:</p>

<p><em>1) Event participant &gt; journalist &gt; New York Times &gt; You</em></p>

<p><em>2) Research data &gt; scientist &gt; research paper &gt; training book &gt; gym trainer &gt; you</em></p>

<p><em>3) Fox News &gt; facebook &gt; your brother &gt; you</em></p>

<p>Your choices are to believe the closest node (i.e. the person/thing you’re hearing the information from) or to dig deeper.</p>

<h6>When can I trust the closest node, and when do I need to go to the source?</h6>

<p>The more general agreement there is on a topic the more you can trust the closest node on the specifics. </p>

<p>To take an extreme example: gravity is well accepted so if you search for details about Newton’s formula you can probably accept the results of some random website.</p>

<p>But when there’s broad disagreement (e.g. how to live a good life, political questions) picking the closest node isn’t a great idea. </p>

<p>My favorite example of this is nutrition. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR US TO EAT? </p>

<p><strong>Nutrition is like religion: everyone thinks their version is The Truth and everyone has their favorite success stories that they use as “proof.”</strong></p>

<p>And yet they ignore the dozens of other groups who have their own success stories &amp; whose ideas are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Ignore the depth of the supply chain at your peril. If you trust too much in the closest node when everyone disagrees it’s <strong>likely</strong> that you’ll be wrong.</p>

<p>Instead you have to get to the bottom: talk to the scientists, read the research papers, get as close to the primary source as possible.</p>

<h6>Why Don’t We Already Do This</h6>

<p>It’s obvious that if you get 10 different answers about the same topic that you should investigate more. And yet so few of us do this.</p>

<p><strong>Because we like to feel comfortable.</strong> It’s hard to not be mentally settled. To not be sure about an important topic you care about.</p>

<p>So we often go with the idea that we find first, or that we like the most. </p>

<p>Which is why the people who do make it through get special bonuses in life.</p>

<p>They’re the ones who find a market’s unmet needs, make significant contributions to science, and otherwise get to the truth. Whatever that may be.</p>

<h6><a href="https://amzn.to/2G71eHw">My Favorite Book From 2018 (So Far)</a> (book)</h6>

<p>Why short-term goals are not only more effective but emotionally liberating.</p>

<h6><a href="https://amzn.to/2pJYllg">Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</a> (book)</h6>

<p>Almost finished with this massive biography that covers Lincoln’s cabinet during the Civil War. </p>

<p>One takeaway is how divided the North was throughout the war: some wanted peace at any cost (e.g. let the South go &amp; continue slavery) while others were true Abolitionists and viewed the war primarily as a battle against slavery.</p>

<p>Full of these and other details that you only learn by reading a book.</p>

<h6><a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_caldbeck/status/977970995863547904">One CEO’s List of Mistakes</a> (tweets)</h6>

<p>Honesty you don’t usually get about behind the scenes.</p>

<p>“I printed out decks for our first few investor meetings in 2012. No entrepreneur in Silicon Valley history has raised money from an investor after showing up with a printed deck. I was not the first. I cringe thinking about those mtgs.”</p>

<p>His company has since gone on to raise over $50 million.</p>

<h6><a href="https://amzn.to/2G8mR6h">The Radicalism of the American Revolution</a> (book)</h6>

<p>The family you came from used to matter more than <strong>anything</strong>. The aristocracy wasn’t just the idea that there was a King, but that there were also many mini-Kings (“The Elites”) whose family each had their own dominion over their area. </p>

<p>This made me appreciate the ideals of American “liberty” and “freedom” even while those words have become cliches.</p>

<p>Fun fact: the author is one of the historian’s mentioned in the early bar scene in <em>Good Will Hunting</em>.</p>
