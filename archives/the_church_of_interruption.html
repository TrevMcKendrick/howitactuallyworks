<h3>The Church of Interruption</h3>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I’m back in SF after a week in DC. It’s good to be back in the land of the builders.</p>

<p>Tommy Collison &amp; I are putting together a monthly brunch/dinner for founders and startup people in SF. If you’re interested in coming please let me know.</p>

<p>“Uncertainty is not just a nuisance startup founders can’t avoid, it is an integral part of what allows startups to be successful. Startups that aim to create value can’t have a moat when they begin, uncertainty is what protects them from competition until a proper moat can be built. Uncertainty becomes their moat.”</p>

<p>“The evidence shows that the strongest predictors of cross-national variation in entrepreneurial activity were normative, with social norms being the most strongly associated with entrepreneurialism and rates of organizational founding.”</p>

<p>“Everyone always talks about how much money there is in politics. This is the wrong framing. The right framing is Ansolabehere et al’s: why is there so little money in politics?”</p>
