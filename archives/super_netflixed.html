<p>Movie about Anand Kumar, the founder of Super 30.</p>

<p>Super 30 is selects 30 kids from impoverished regions of India and prepares them for the entrance exam to IIT. In 2008, six years after the founding, all 30 kids passed.</p>

<p>How many more kids beyond those 30 could be trained to get into IIT? I wonder if you could build a business around that… </p>

<p>“But if you underestimate the resources you need by 3–5x, then when you get close to the end of them, you don’t even see the light at the end of the tunnel. And so you don’t know whether you’re in a tunnel, or just going deeper into a cave with a dead end. You start questioning everything about the project, including whether it’s even the right project.”</p>
